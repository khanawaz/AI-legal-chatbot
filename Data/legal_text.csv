OKA, J. FACTUAL ASPECT 1. On 26th January 2025, our Constitution became 75 years old. One of the most important fundamental rights conferred on the citizens of India is under Article 19 (1)(a) of the Constitution. It is the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression. This case shows that even after 75 years of the existence of our Constitution, the law enforcement machinery of the State is either ignorant about this important fundamental right or does not care for this fundamental right.

Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,1,". The issue in this appeal revolves around a poem recited in the background of a video clip. The video clip was posted on social media by the appellant. The text of the poem has been reproduced in paragraph 13 of the impugned judgment, which reads thus: “ए खून (blood) के प्यासो (thirsty) बात सुनो ग़र हक्क़ (truth) की लडाई जुल्म (excesses/injustice) सही हम जुल्म (excesses/injustice) से इश्क़ (love) ननभा देंगे गर शम- ए- नगररया (melting of a candle which resembles tears) आनतश (flame) है हर राह वो शम्मा (light) जला देंगे गर लाश हमारे अपनोंकी खतरा है तुम्हारी मसनद (throne) का उस रब (god) की ़सम हस्ते हस्ते नकतनी लाशे दफ़ना देंगे ए खूनके प्यासों बात सुनो” 3. The appellant is a Member of the Rajya Sabha. The 2nd respondent is the first informant at whose instance a First Information Report (for short, ‘FIR’) was registered with Jamnagar Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 196, 197(1), 302, 299, 57 and 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (for short, ‘the BNS’)"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,2,". In the complaint of the 2nd respondent, he stated that on 29th December 2024, on the occasion of the birthday of one Altaf Ghafarbhai Khafi, a member of the Municipal Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  Corporation of Jamnagar, a mass wedding program was held at Sanjari Education and Charitable Trust. The said Municipal Councillor invited the present appellant to the function. A video of the event was made. The appellant posted the video on the social media platform ‘X’ from his verified account. The video has the recitation of the poem reproduced above in the background. The allegation in the complaint is that the spoken words of the poem incite people of one community against another, and it hurts a community's religious and social sentiments. It is alleged that the song had lyrics that incited people of other communities to fight for the community's rights"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,3,". It is alleged that the video posted by the appellant created enmity between two communities at the national level and hatred towards each other. It was further alleged that it had a detrimental effect on national unity. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE HIGH COURT 4. The appellant filed a petition under Section 528 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (for short, ‘the BNSS’) read with Article 226 of the Constitution of India, praying for quashing the said FIR. While issuing notice on the said petition, the learned Judge had directed the appellant to file an affidavit disclosing the poem's source. Accordingly, an affidavit was filed by the appellant. In paragraphs 3 to 5 of the affidavit, he stated thus: Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  “3. In compliance with this Hon'ble Court's oral order dated 13.01.2025 in R/Special Criminal Application (Quashing) No"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,4,".01.2025 in R/Special Criminal Application (Quashing) No.551 of 2025, I stated that the poem in question, based on available information, including sources reviewed through ChatGPT and public domain opinions, the poem is attributed to either Faiz Ahmed Faiz or Habib Jalib. However, as internet opinions remain divided, I am unable to conclusively ascertain the definite authorship between the two. A copy of the screenshot of the results of ChatGPT search engine are annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE-A. 4. It is further stated that a plain reading of the song poem, it is a message of love and non-violence 5. I further solemnly affirm that I am not the writer of the song/poem in question. 6. I state that the annexures produced with this affidavit are true copies of their originals.” (emphasis added) 5"

By the impugned judgment and order, the learned Single Judge rejected the petition by holding that as the investigation is at a very nascent stage, interference cannot be made in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. v State of Maharashtra1. 1 2021 SCC Online SC 315 Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  SUBMISSIONS 6. The submission of the appellant in support of the appeal is that none of the ingredients of the offences alleged against the appellant are made out on the plain reading of the complaint and the poem. It is pointed out in the appeal that, as it usually happens, posting the video on the social media site ‘X’ receives several responses, some in favour, some against. Therefore, it cannot be said that the poem caused social disharmony amongst the people"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,6,". Therefore, it cannot be said that the poem caused social disharmony amongst the people. It is submitted that the poem does not promote disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between the various religious, racial, language or regional groups and castes or communities. It is submitted that, on its plain reading, it is about sacrificing oneself to fight for rights and truth. The poem promotes non-violence and preaches that one must suffer injustice with love. The submission of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant is that registering FIR based on the said poem violates the appellant's fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. He submitted that the police have shown insensitivity. Even the High Court has not attempted to appreciate the message sought to be conveyed by the poem. 7. The Learned Solicitor General of India has taken a fair stand and has left it to the Court to make an Criminal Appeal No"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,7,".1545 of 2025  appropriate decision. He, however, submitted that the tall claim made by the appellant on oath that the poem's author can be either Faiz Ahmed Faiz or Habib Jalib is entirely wrong. He submitted that the said contention raised by the appellant on oath has no basis at all. He submitted that it is the obligation of the police to register an FIR. The High Court has followed the law while rejecting the appellant’s petition. Therefore, the criticism made by the learned senior counsel for the appellant about the approach of the High Court is not correct. 8. The office report of 7th February 2025 records that affidavit of dasti service on 2nd respondent has been filed. None appeared for the respondent. CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS WORDS SPOKEN 9"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,8,". None appeared for the respondent. CONSIDERATION OF SUBMISSIONS WORDS SPOKEN 9.

Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,9,".” 10. On plain reading of the original Urdu version and its English translation, the following conclusions can be drawn: a) This poem has nothing to do with any religion, community, region or race; b) By no stretch of imagination, the contents affect national integration; c) It does not jeopardise the sovereignty, unity, integrity or security of India; d) It suggests that while fighting to secure our rights if we are met with injustice, we will face it with love. We will use our tears as flames to light up all paths; e) It gives a warning to the throne (the rulers). It states that if the bodies of our loved ones are a threat to the rulers, we will bury our loved ones happily; f) It preaches non-violence. It says that if the fight for our rights is met with injustice, we will meet injustice with love. This gives a message that Criminal Appeal No"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,10,". This gives a message that Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  injustice should not be retaliated, but it should be met with love; g) The poem refers to the throne in the context of the fight against injustice. The reference to the throne is symbolic. It is a reference to an entity which is responsible for causing injustice. It gives a warning that if the bodies of loved ones are a threat to the throne, we will happily accept the deaths of our loved ones. It suggests that one should be willing to sacrifice life in the fight against injustice; and h) Thus, the poem does not encourage violence. On the contrary, it encourages people to desist from resorting to violence and to face injustice with love. It states that if our fight with injustice results into the death of our near and dear ones, we would be happy to bury their bodies. WHETHER ANY OFFENCE IS MADE OUT 11.

Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,14,".” (emphasis added) Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  12. The poem does not refer to any religion, caste or language. It does not refer to persons belonging to any religion. By no stretch of imagination, does it promote enmity between different groups. We fail to understand how the statements therein are detrimental to national unity and how the statements will affect national unity. On its plain reading, the poem does not purport to affect anyone's religious feelings. 13. Now, let us examine whether any offence as alleged is attracted. Section 196 of the BNS reads thus: “196. Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony"

Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,18,". On a plain reading of the poem, we find that the same has nothing to do with any religion, caste, community or any particular group. The poem's words do not bring about or promote disharmony or feelings of hatred or ill-will. It only seeks to challenge the injustice made by the ruler. It is impossible to say that the words used by the appellant disturb or are likely to disturb public tranquility. Therefore, neither clause (a) nor clause (b) of Section 196 (1) are attracted. There is no allegation against the appellant of organising any exercise, movement, drill or similar activity. There is no allegation against the appellant that he uttered the words in any place of worship or in any assembly engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies. Hence, clause (c) will have no application. The appellant has put a video of a mass marriage function, and in the background, the words are uttered. Therefore, Section 196 can have no application. Criminal Appeal No"

(2) Whoever commits an offence specified in sub-section (1) in any place of worship or in any assembly engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine.” 16. As stated earlier, the poem does not make or publish any imputation and is not concerned with any religious, racial, language, regional group, caste, or community. It does not suggest that any class of persons have been denied rights as citizens because they are members of a religious, racial, language, regional group, caste, or community. It does not make or publish any assertion, counsel, plea or appeal likely to cause disharmony or feeling of enmity or hatred or ill will. The poem does not publish or make any false or misleading information"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,23,". The poem does not publish or make any false or misleading information. 17. Offence under Section 299 of the BNS is also alleged against the appellant, which reads thus: “299. Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.—Whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  feelings of any class of citizens of India, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or through electronic means or otherwise, insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.” To say the least, it is ridiculous to say that the act of the appellant is intended to outrage the religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,24,". The poem only tells the rulers what the reaction will be if the fight for rights is met with injustice. 18. Even offence under Section 302 of the BNS has been alleged, which reads thus: “302. Uttering words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound religious feelings of any person.—Whoever, with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person or makes any gesture in the sight of that person or places any object in the sight of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.” An offence under Section 302 will be made out if any words are uttered with the deliberate intention of wounding the Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  religious feelings of any person. Even this section is not applicable on its face. 19. Section 57 of the BNS is alleged to be applicable, which reads thus: “57"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,25,". 19. Section 57 of the BNS is alleged to be applicable, which reads thus: “57. Abetting commission of offence by public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years and with fine.” We fail to understand, even if it is assumed that the appellant has committed some offence, how he has abetted the commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten. OBLIGATION TO REGISTER A FIRST INFORMATION REPORT 20. The question is whether in the facts of the case, it was obligatory under sub-Section (1) of Section 173 of the BNSS to register FIR. Section 173, which deals with information in cognizable cases, reads thus: “173. Information in cognizable cases"

It may be given orally or by electronic communication to the officer-in- charge of a police station.

Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,32,". No further inquiry can be made by the police officer if the information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. Therefore, subject to the exception carved out by sub-Section (3) of Section 173, which we will deal with later, it is mandatory to record the information in a book. Thus, it is mandatory to register the FIR if information received discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  21. Section 154 of the CrPC reads thus: “154.

Sub-Section (1) of Section 173 of BNSS is substantially the same as Sub-Section (1) of Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘the CrPC’). Therefore, the law laid down by this Court in the case of Lalita Kumari v. Govt. of U.P.2 on Section 154 of the CrPC will be relevant"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,37,". Govt. of U.P.2 on Section 154 of the CrPC will be relevant. Paragraph 120 of the said decision containing conclusions/directions reads thus: 2 (2014) 2 SCC 1 Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  “120. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold: 120.1. The registration of FIR is mandatory under Section 154 of the Code, if the information discloses commission of a cognizable offence and no preliminary inquiry is permissible in such a situation. 120.2. If the information received does not disclose a cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an inquiry, a preliminary inquiry may be conducted only to ascertain whether cognizable offence is disclosed or not. 120.3. If the inquiry discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, the FIR must be registered. In cases where preliminary inquiry ends in closing the complaint, a copy of the entry of such closure must be supplied to the first informant forthwith and not later than one week"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,38,. It must disclose reasons in brief for closing the complaint and not proceeding further. 120.4. The police officer cannot avoid his duty of registering offence if cognizable offence is disclosed. Action must be taken against erring officers who do not register the FIR if information received by him discloses a cognizable offence. 120.5. The scope of preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity or otherwise of the information received but only to ascertain whether the information reveals any cognizable offence. Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  120.6. As to what type and in which cases preliminary inquiry is to be conducted will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,39,". The category of cases in which preliminary inquiry may be made are as under: (a) Matrimonial disputes/family disputes (b) Commercial offences (c) Medical negligence cases (d) Corruption cases (e) Cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over 3 months' delay in reporting the matter without satisfactorily explaining the reasons for delay. The aforesaid are only illustrations and not exhaustive of all conditions which may warrant preliminary inquiry. 120.7. While ensuring and protecting the rights of the accused and the complainant, a preliminary inquiry should be made time- bound and in any case it should not exceed fifteen days generally and in exceptional cases, by giving adequate reasons, six weeks' time is provided. The fact of such delay and the causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary entry. 120.8"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,40,". The fact of such delay and the causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary entry. 120.8. Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is the record of all information received in a police station, we direct that all information relating to cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration of FIR or leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily and meticulously Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  reflected in the said diary and the decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be reflected, as mentioned above.” (emphasis added) 23. Section 154 of the CrPC does not provide for making any preliminary inquiry. However, as held in the case of Lalita Kumari2, a preliminary inquiry is permissible if the information received does not disclose a cognizable offence and indicates the necessity for an inquiry. A preliminary inquiry must be conducted only to ascertain whether a cognizable offence is disclosed"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,41,". However, sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS makes a significant departure from Section 154 of the CrPC. It provides that when information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence which is made punishable for 3 years or more but less than 7 years is received by an officer-in-charge of a police station, with the prior permission of a superior officer as mentioned therein, the police officer is empowered to conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether there exists a prima facie case for proceeding in the matter. However, under Section 154 of the CrPC, as held in the case of Lalita Kumari2, only a limited preliminary inquiry is permissible to ascertain whether the information received discloses a cognizable offence. Moreover, a preliminary inquiry can be made under the CrPC only if the information does not disclose the Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  commission of a cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an inquiry"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,42,".1545 of 2025  commission of a cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an inquiry. Sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS is an exception to sub-Section (1) of Section 173. In the category of cases covered by sub-Section (3), a police officer is empowered to make a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether a prima facie case is made out for proceeding in the matter even if the information received discloses commission of any cognizable offence. That is very apparent as sub-Section (3) of Section 173 refers explicitly to receiving information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence. Therefore, in a case where sub-Section (3) of Section 173 is applicable, even if the information pertaining to the commission of any cognizable offence is received, an inquiry can be conducted to ascertain whether a prima facie case exists for proceeding in the matter"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,43,". The intention appears to be to prevent the registration of FIRs in frivolous cases where punishment is up to 7 years, even if the information discloses the commission of the cognizable offence. However, under Section 154 of the CrPC, the inquiry permitted by paragraph 120.2 of the decision in the case of Lalita Kumari2 is limited only to ascertain whether the cognizable offence is disclosed. 24. Under sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS, after holding a preliminary inquiry, if the officer comes to a conclusion that a prima facie case exists to proceed, he Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  should immediately register an FIR and proceed to investigate. But, if he is of the view that a prima facie case is not made out to proceed, he should immediately inform the first informant/complainant so that he can avail a remedy under sub-Section (4) of Section 173. 25"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,44,". 25. Before we go into the applicability of sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS to the facts of the case, we must deal with sub-Section (1) of Section 173. Take a case where a person approaches an officer-in-charge of a police station either personally or by electronic communication and alleges that he has seen ‘A’ assaulting ‘X’ with a stick. If the injury caused is simple, it will be an offence punishable under Section 115 (2) of the BNS. As per the first Schedule of the BNSS, it is a non-cognizable offence. Therefore, based on such information, FIR cannot be registered. If grievous hurt is caused, it will be an offence punishable under Section 117 (2) of the BNS, which is a cognizable offence. Therefore, the allegations made in the information furnished to an officer-in-charge of a police station must be examined by the officer only with a view to ascertain whether a cognizable offence is made out"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,45,". Taking the information as correct, the officer has to determine whether it makes out a case of the commission of a cognizable offence. If the allegation makes out a case of a cognizable offence, unless the offence falls in sub-Section (3) of Section 173, it is mandatory to register FIR. Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  26. Coming back to the offence punishable under Section 196 of the BNS to decide whether the words, either spoken or written or by sign or by visible representations or through electronic communication or otherwise, lead to the consequences provided in the Section. The police officer to whom information is furnished will have to read or hear the words written or spoken, and by taking the same as correct, decide whether an offence under Section 196 is made out. Reading of written words, or hearing spoken words will be necessary to determine whether the contents make out a case of the commission of a cognizable offence"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,46,". The same is the case with offences punishable under Sections 197, 299 and 302 of the BNS. Therefore, to ascertain whether the information received by an officer-in-charge of the police station makes out a cognizable offence, the officer must consider the meaning of the spoken or written words. This act on the part of the police officer will not amount to making a preliminary inquiry which is not permissible under sub-Section (1) of Section 173. 27. We will give an example. A person utters the following words. “If the rulers attack me, I will not retaliate and, on the contrary, face the attack with love. If I do that, it will lead to the defeat of the rulers.” If the person who furnishes information, alleges that these words are spoken or written to promote enmity between different groups as provided in Criminal Appeal No"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,47,".1545 of 2025  Section 196, while deciding whether the information is of commission of a cognizable offence, the officer concerned will have to read and understand the meaning of the alleged spoken words. This exercise does not amount to making a preliminary inquiry which is prohibited under sub-Section (1) of Section 173 of BNSS. 28. Sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS confers a discretion on the officer receiving information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence to conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether a prima facie case exists to proceed. This option is available when the offence alleged is made punishable for 3 years or more but less than 7 years. In the facts of the case, all the offences except the offence under Section 57 of the BNS are punishable by imprisonment for less than 7 years. Section 57, on the face of it, is not applicable. Therefore, this option was also available to the police officer in the present case"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,48,". Therefore, this option was also available to the police officer in the present case. The officer did not exercise the said option. 29. At this stage, we may refer to clause (a) of Article 51- A of the Constitution, which reads thus: “51-A. Fundamental duties.—It shall be the duty of every citizen of India— (a) to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem; Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  …………………………………………………..” The police officers must abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals. The philosophy of the Constitution and its ideals can be found in the preamble itself. The preamble lays down that the people of India have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic and to secure all its citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. Therefore, liberty of thoughts and expression is one of the ideals of our Constitution"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,49,". Therefore, liberty of thoughts and expression is one of the ideals of our Constitution. Article 19(1)(a) confers a fundamental right on all citizens to freedom of speech and expression. The police machinery is a part of the State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. Moreover, the police officers being citizens, are bound to abide by the Constitution. They are bound to honour and uphold freedom of speech and expression conferred on all citizens. Clause (2) of Article 19 of the Constitution carves out an exception to the fundamental right guaranteed under sub- clause (a) of clause (1) of Article 19. If there is a law covered by clause (2), its operation remains unaffected by sub- clause (a) of clause (1). We must remember that laws covered by the clause (2) are protected by way of an exception provided they impose a reasonable restriction. Article 19(2) is an exception to the freedom enumerated under Article 19(1)(a)"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,50,". Article 19(2) is an exception to the freedom enumerated under Article 19(1)(a). The reasonable restrictions provided Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  for in Article 19(2) must remain reasonable and not fanciful and oppressive. Article 19(2) cannot be allowed to overshadow the substantive rights under Article 19(1), including the right to freedom of speech and expression. Therefore, when an allegation is of the commission of an offence covered by the law referred to in clause (2) of Article 19, if sub-Section (3) of Section 173 is applicable, it is always appropriate to conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether a prima facie case is made out to proceed against the accused. This will ensure that the fundamental rights guaranteed under sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of Article 19 remain protected. Therefore, in such cases, the higher police officer referred to in sub-Section (3) of Section 173 must normally grant permission to the police officer to conduct a preliminary inquiry"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,51,". Therefore, when the commission of cognizable offences is alleged, where punishment is for imprisonment up to 7 years, which is based on spoken or written words, it will always be appropriate to exercise the option under sub-Section (3) of Section 173 and conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether there exists a prima facie case to proceed. If an option under sub-Section (3) is not exercised by the police officer in such a case, he may end up registering an FIR against a person who has exercised his fundamental right under Article 19 (1)(a) even though clause (2) of Article 19 is not attracted. If, in such cases, Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  the option under sub-Section (3) of Section 173 is not exercised, it will defeat the very object of incorporating sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS and will also defeat the obligation of the police under Article 51-A (a). 30"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,52,". 30. Even while dealing with the performance of an obligation under sub-Section (1) of Section 173, where the commission of the offence is based on spoken or written words, the police officer concerned will have to keep in mind the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) read with an exception carved out under clause (2) of Article 19. The reason is that he is under an obligation to abide by the Constitution and to respect the ideals under the Constitution. The Constitution is more than 75 years old. By this time, the police officers ought to have been sensitized about their duty of abiding by the Constitution and respecting the ideals of the Constitution. If the police officers are not aware of these obligations, the State must ensure that they are educated and sensitized by starting massive training programs. 31"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,53,". 31. In the facts of the case, even without taking recourse to sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS, the information furnished to the police officer did not attract the offences punishable under Sections 196, 197, 299 and 302 of the BNS. Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  STANDARD TO BE APPLIED 32. At this stage, we cannot resist the temptation of quoting what Bose and Puranik, JJ., authored as the Judges of the erstwhile Nagpur High Court. In the case of Bhagwati Charan Shukla v. Provincial Government, C.P. & Berar3, in paragraph 67, it is held thus: “67. Viewing the impugned article in that light we are of opinion, as a matter of fact, that it is not seditious because its professed aim is to obtain a change of Government through the ballot box and not to incite people to a disobedience of the laws of Government"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,54,". Some extravagance of language there is, and there is the usual crude emotional appeal which is the stock in trade of the demagogue, as well as a blundering and ineffective attempt to ape the poets. But that is all. However, it is not enough to find that the writer is not guilty of sedition because we are concerned with Section 4 of the Press (Emergency Powers) Act which travels wider than S. 124 A. We have therefore further to see whether these words tend directly or indirectly to incite to sedition, or, in the words of the Ordinance, whether they are intended or are likely to produce that effect. We say deliberately whether the words are likely to incite to sedition because, as the Federal Court points out, the formula of words used in S. 4, as also in the Ordinance, is precisely the formula used in S. 124 A, 3 1946 SCC OnLine MP 5 Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  therefore to the extent of the formula the two things are the same"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,55,".1545 of 2025  therefore to the extent of the formula the two things are the same. The only difference is that under the Press Act we have to consider not only whether there is sedition in fact but also whether the words tend, directly or indirectly, to excite to sedition and whether they are intended or are likely to produce that effect. We pause to observe that here, as in the case of reasonable doubt in criminal cases, and as in the case of putting in fear of hurt in a matter of assault, we must use the standards of reasonable, strong- minded, firm and courageous men, and not those of weak and vacillating minds, nor of those who scent danger in every hostile point of view. Using those standards we hold as a fact that the effects apprehended by the Crown and required by the section are not likely to be caused by this article, nor do the words used, viewed in their proper setting, tend to cause that effect. The paper is in English. It has a limited circulation"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,56,". The paper is in English. It has a limited circulation. It is read by those who know and understand English. It is a party paper and is read mainly by persons who are politically minded. They are aware of contemporary political thought and occurrences. They realise as well as any one else that neither His Excellency the Governor nor his advisers went round shooting and killing persons. They know that these acts were done by the troops and by the police. They know that there was a demand for an impartial investigation and a judicial enquiry. They know that the demand was refused and they know that the whole complaint, so far as Government is Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  concerned, lies there. They are therefore no more likely to attribute to Government any greater responsibility than Mr. Jamnadas Mehta and other members of the Central Assembly did. They are as much aware as the writer that the appeal is for a constitutional change of Government by constitutional means"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,57,". They were not, in our opinion, likely to interpret it otherwise. Therefore, in our judgment, the article does not tend, directly or indirectly to sedition, nor is it likely to produce that result. In out view, the applications should be allowed and the orders of forfeiture set aside. The costs should, we think, in each case be paid by the Crown.” (emphasis added) 33. What is held by Bose and Puranik, JJ. has been quoted with approval in at least two cases. The first such case is in the decision of Manzar Sayeed Khan v. State of Maharashtra4. The second case is the decision in the case of Ramesh v. Union of India5. Finally, the view taken by Bose and Puranil,JJ., as the Judges of Nagpur High Court, is again quoted with approval by this Court in the case of Javed Ahmad Hajam v. State of Maharashtra6 . This Court in the case of Javed Ahmad Hajam6 , was dealing with an offence punishable under Section 153-A of the IPC"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,58,". Section 153-A of the IPC is pari materia with 4 (2007) 5 SCC 1 5 (1988) 1 SCC 668 6 (2024) 4 SCC 156 Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  Section 196 of the BNS. The only difference is that the words ‘or through electric communication’ have been added in clause (a) of Section 196 of the BNS, which were not in clause (a) of Section 153-A of the IPC. When an offence punishable under Section 196 of BNS is alleged, the effect of the spoken or written words will have to be considered based on standards of reasonable, strong- minded, firm and courageous individuals and not based on the standards of people with weak and oscillating minds. The effect of the spoken or written words cannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position. INGREDIENT OF MENS REA 34. In the case of Manzar Sayeed Khan4 and the case of Patricia Mukhim v"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,59,". INGREDIENT OF MENS REA 34. In the case of Manzar Sayeed Khan4 and the case of Patricia Mukhim v. State of Meghalaya7, the ingredient of mens rea has been read into Section 153-A of IPC by this Court. Paragraphs 8 to 14 of the decision in the case of Javed Ahmad Hajam6, which analyses both the above decisions, read thus: “8. This Court in Manzar Sayeed Khan referred to the view taken by Vivian Bose, J., as a Judge of the erstwhile Nagpur High Court in Bhagwati Charan Shukla v. Provincial Govt. A Division Bench of the High Court dealt with the offence 7 (2021) 15 SCC 35 Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  of sedition under Section 124-AIPC and Section 4(1) of the Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931. The issue was whether a particular article in the press tends, directly or indirectly, to bring hatred or contempt to the Government established in law. This Court has approved this view in its decision in Ramesh v. Union of India"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,60,". This Court has approved this view in its decision in Ramesh v. Union of India . In the said case, this Court dealt with the issue of applicability of Section 153-AIPC. In para 13, it was held thus : “13. … the effect of the words must be judged from the standards of reasonable, strong- minded, firm and courageous men, and not those of weak and vacillating minds, nor of those who scent danger in every hostile point of view. … It is the standard of ordinary reasonable man or as they say in English law ‘the man on the top of a Clapham omnibus’. (emphasis supplied) Therefore, the yardstick laid down by Vivian Bose, J., will have to be applied while judging the effect of the words, spoken or written, in the context of Section 153-AIPC. 9. We may also make a useful reference to a decision of this Court in Patricia Mukhim v. State of Meghalaya. Paras 8 to 10 of the said decision read thus : “8"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,61,". State of Meghalaya. Paras 8 to 10 of the said decision read thus : “8. ‘It is of utmost importance to keep all speech free in order for the truth to emerge and have a civil society.’— Thomas Jefferson. Freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution is a very valuable fundamental right. However, the right is not absolute. Reasonable restrictions can be placed on the right of free speech and expression in the Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of Court, defamation or incitement to an offence. Speech crime is punishable under Section 153-AIPC. Promotion of enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,62,". and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to three years or with fine or with both under Section 153-A. As we are called upon to decide whether a prima facie case is made out against the appellant for committing offences under Sections 153-A and 505(1)(c), it is relevant to reproduce the provisions which are as follows: *** 9. Only where the written or spoken words have the tendency of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order or affecting public tranquillity, the law needs to step in to prevent such an activity. The intention to cause disorder or incite people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under Section 153-AIPC and the prosecution has to prove the existence of mens rea in order to succeed. 10. The gist of the offence under Section 153- AIPC is the intention to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of people"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,63,". The intention has to be judged primarily by the language of the piece of writing and the circumstances in which it was written and published. The matter complained of within the ambit of Section 153-A must be read as a whole. Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  One cannot rely on strongly worded and isolated passages for proving the charge nor indeed can one take a sentence here and a sentence there and connect them by a meticulous process of inferential reasoning.” (emphasis in original and supplied) 10. Now, coming back to Section 153-A, clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 153-AIPC is attracted when by words, either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, an attempt is made to promote disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,64,". The promotion of disharmony, enmity, hatred or ill will must be on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste, community or any other analogous grounds. Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 153- AIPC will apply only when an act is committed which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquillity. 11. Now, coming to the words used by the appellant on his WhatsApp status, we may note here that the first statement is that August 5 is a Black Day for Jammu and Kashmir. 5-8-2019 is the day on which Article 370 of the Constitution of India was abrogated, and two separate Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir were formed. Further, the appellant has posted that “Article 370 was abrogated, we are not happy”. On a plain reading, the Criminal Appeal No"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,65,". On a plain reading, the Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  appellant intended to criticise the action of the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India. He has expressed unhappiness over the said act of abrogation. The aforesaid words do not refer to any religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community. It is a simple protest by the appellant against the decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution of India and the further steps taken based on that decision. The Constitution of India, under Article 19(1)(a), guarantees freedom of speech and expression. Under the said guarantee, every citizen has the right to offer criticism of the action of abrogation of Article 370 or, for that matter, every decision of the State. He has the right to say he is unhappy with any decision of the State. 12. In Manzar Sayeed Khan, this Court has read “intention” as an essential ingredient of the said offence"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,66,". The alleged objectionable words or expressions used by the appellant, on its plain reading, cannot promote disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities. The WhatsApp status of the appellant has a photograph of two barbed wires, below which it is mentioned that “AUGUST 5 — BLACK DAY — JAMMU & KASHMIR”. This is an expression of his individual view and his reaction to the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India. It does not reflect any intention to do something which is prohibited under Section 153-A. At best, it is a protest, which is a part of Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  his freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a). 13. Every citizen of India has a right to be critical of the action of abrogation of Article 370 and the change of status of Jammu and Kashmir"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,67,". Describing the day the abrogation happened as a “Black Day” is an expression of protest and anguish. If every criticism or protest of the actions of the State is to be held as an offence under Section 153-A, democracy, which is an essential feature of the Constitution of India, will not survive. 14. The right to dissent in a legitimate and lawful manner is an integral part of the rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a). Every individual must respect the right of others to dissent. An opportunity to peacefully protest against the decisions of the Government is an essential part of democracy. The right to dissent in a lawful manner must be treated as a part of the right to lead a dignified and meaningful life guaranteed by Article 21. But the protest or dissent must be within four corners of the modes permissible in a democratic set up. It is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in accordance with clause (2) of Article 19"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,68,". It is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in accordance with clause (2) of Article 19. In the present case, the appellant has not at all crossed the line.” Hence, mens rea will have to be read into Section 196 of the BNS. In this case, looking to the text of the words spoken and the context in which those were spoken, it is impossible to attribute any mens rea to the appellant. Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  IMPUGNED JUDGMENT 35. Now, we come to the impugned judgment. The decisions of this Court in the case of Manzar Sayeed Khan4 and Javed Ahmad Hajam6 were relied upon by the appellant before the High Court. Therefore, the High Court was aware that it was dealing with the appellant's fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19 (1)(a) of the Constitution. The High Court quoted both decisions extensively in the judgment. What is surprising is the finding recorded by the High Court. The finding on merits is only in paragraph 22 of the judgment, which reads thus: “22"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,69,". The finding on merits is only in paragraph 22 of the judgment, which reads thus: “22. Looking to the tenor of the poem, it certainly indicates something about the throne. The responses received to the said post by other persons also indicate that message was posted in a manner which certainly create disturbance in social harmony. It is expected from any citizen of India that he should behave in a manner where the communal harmony or social harmony should not be disturbed, and the petitioner, who is a Member of Parliament, is expected to behave in some more restricted manner as he is expected to know more about the repercussions of such post.” 36. In the instant case, as we have seen, no prima facie case can be said to have been made out against the appellant qua the sections invoked. In such a case, registration of the FIR appears to be a very mechanical Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  exercise and is a clear abuse of the process of law"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,70,".1545 of 2025  exercise and is a clear abuse of the process of law. In fact, registration of such FIR virtually borders on perversity. We are surprised that this very crucial aspect escaped the notice of the High Court. The High Court ought to have nipped the mischief at the threshold itself. 37. We fail to understand how the High Court concluded that the message was posted in a manner that would certainly disturb social harmony. Thereafter, the High Court gave a reason that the investigation was at a nascent stage. There is no absolute rule that when the investigation is at a nascent stage, the High Court cannot exercise its jurisdiction to quash an offence by exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or under Section 482 of the CrPC equivalent to Section 528 of the BNSS"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,71,". When the High Court, in the given case, finds that no offence was made out on the face of it, to prevent abuse of the process of law, it can always interfere even though the investigation is at the nascent stage. It all depends on the facts and circumstances of each case as well as the nature of the offence. There is no such blanket rule putting an embargo on the powers of the High Court to quash FIR only on the ground that the investigation was at a nascent stage. If such embargo is taken as an absolute rule, it will substantially curtail the powers of the High Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  Court which have been laid down and recognised by this Court in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal8. IMPORTANCE OF THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE DUTY OF THE COURTS 38. Free expression of thoughts and views by individuals or groups of individuals is an integral part of a healthy, civilised society"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,72,". Without freedom of expression of thoughts and views, it is impossible to lead a dignified life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. In a healthy democracy, the views, opinions or thoughts expressed by an individual or group of individuals must be countered by expressing another point of view. Even if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected. Literature including poetry, dramas, films, stage shows, satire and art, make the life of human beings more meaningful. The Courts are duty-bound to uphold and enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India. Sometimes, we, the Judges, may not like spoken or written words. But, still, it is our duty to uphold the fundamental right under Article 19 (1)(a). We Judges are also under an obligation to uphold the Constitution and respect its ideals"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,73,". We Judges are also under an obligation to uphold the Constitution and respect its ideals. If the police or executive fail to honour and protect the fundamental 8 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  rights guaranteed under Article 19 (1)(a) of the Constitution, it is the duty of the Courts to step in and protect the fundamental rights. There is no other institution which can uphold the fundamental rights of the citizens. 39. Courts, particularly the constitutional Courts, must be at the forefront to zealously protect the fundamental rights of the citizens. It is the bounden duty of the Courts to ensure that the Constitution and the ideals of the Constitution are not trampled upon. Endeavour of the courts should always be to protect and promote the fundamental rights, including the freedom of speech and expression, which is one of the most cherished rights a citizen can have in a liberal constitutional democracy"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,74,". The Courts must not be seen to regulate or stifle the freedom of speech and expression. As a matter of fact, the Courts must remain ever vigilant to thwart any attempt to undermine the Constitution and the constitutional values, including the freedom of speech and expression. 40. Before we part with this judgment, we must refer to two important judgments. More than two decades ago, a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court was examining an order of the Government of Maharashtra directing forfeiture of all copies, manuscripts etc. of a play called Mee Nathuram Godse Boltoy in Anand Chintamani Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  Dighe and anr. Vs. State of Maharashtra and ors.9. While quashing the order of forfeiture passed by the Government of Maharashtra, Justice Dr. D.Y"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,75,".9. While quashing the order of forfeiture passed by the Government of Maharashtra, Justice Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud (as he then was) speaking for the Bench observed that Government in that particular case seemed to have acted in the wake of the criticism voiced against the play and of the sense of outrage of those who believed that the play unfairly criticized the father of the nation. He highlighted the eternal values on which the Constitution of a democracy is founded. Acceptance of the freedom to express a view which may not accord with the mainstream are cardinal values. A society wedded to the rule of law cannot trample upon the rights of those who assert views which may be regarded as unpopular or contrary to the views shared by the majority. Right of the playwright, of the artist, writer and of the poet will be reduced to husk if the freedom to portray a message – whether it be in canvas, prose or verse – is to depend upon the popular perception of the acceptability of that message"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,76,". Popular perceptions cannot override constitutional values such as the guarantee of freedom. Relevant portion of the aforesaid judgment is extracted hereunder with approval: “19. …….But, it is important to realise that there are eternal values on which the Constitution of a democracy is founded. 9 2001 SCC OnLine Bom 891 Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  Tolerance of a diversity of view points and the acceptance of the freedom to express of those whose thinking may not accord with the mainstream are cardinal values which lie at the very foundation of a democratic form of Government. A society wedded to the rule of law, cannot trample upon the rights of those who assert views which may be regarded as unpopular or contrary to the views shared by a majority. The law does not have to accept the views which have been expressed by the petitioner in the play in order to respect the right of the petitioner as a playwright to express those views"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,77,". Respect for and tolerance of a diversity of viewpoints is what ultimately sustains a democratic society and Government. The right of the playwright, of the artist, writer and of the poet will be reduced to husk if the freedom to portray a message - whether it be in canvas, prose or verse - is to depend upon the popular perception of the acceptability of that message. Popular perceptions, however strong cannot override values which the constitution embodies as guarantees of freedom in what was always intended to be a free society.” (emphasis added) Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  41. In Shreya Singhal v. Union of India10, this Court was examining the vires of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which provided for punishment for sending offensive messages through communication service etc"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,78,". In the above context the Bench referred to Article 19(1)(a), Article 19(2), Preamble to the Constitution of India and the previous decisions of this Court and after a threadbare analysis observed that when it comes to democracy, liberty of thought and expression is a cardinal value that is of paramount significance under our constitutional scheme. It is one of the most basic human rights. 42. Following is the summary of our conclusions: (i) Sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS makes a significant departure from Section 154 of CrPC. It provides that when information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence which is made punishable for 3 years or more but less than 7 years is received by an officer-in- charge of a police station, with the prior permission of a superior officer as mentioned therein, the police officer is empowered to conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether there exists a prima facie case for 10 (2015) SCC 1 Criminal Appeal No"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,79,".1545 of 2025  proceeding in the matter. However, under Section 154 of the CrPC, as held in the case of Lalita Kumari2, only a limited preliminary inquiry is permissible to ascertain whether the information received discloses a cognizable offence. Moreover, a preliminary inquiry can be made under the CrPC only if the information does not disclose the commission of a cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an inquiry. Sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS is an exception to sub-Section (1) of Section 173. In the category of cases covered by sub-Section (3), a police officer is empowered to make a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether a prima facie case is made out for proceeding in the matter even if the information received discloses commission of any cognizable offence"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,80,". (ii) Under sub-Section (3) of Section 173 of the BNSS, after holding a preliminary inquiry, if the officer comes to a conclusion that a prima facie case exists to proceed, he should immediately register an FIR and proceed to investigate. But, if he is of the view that a prima facie case is not made out to proceed, he should immediately inform the first informant/complainant so that Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  he can avail a remedy under sub-Section (4) of Section 173. (iii) In case of the offence punishable under Section 196 of the BNS to decide whether the words, either spoken or written or by sign or by visible representations or through electronic communication or otherwise, lead to the consequences provided in the Section, the police officer to whom information is furnished will have to read or hear the words written or spoken, and by taking the same as correct, decide whether an offence under Section 196 is made out"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,81,". Reading of written words, or hearing spoken words will be necessary to determine whether the contents make out a case of the commission of a cognizable offence. The same is the case with offences punishable under Sections 197, 299 and 302 of BNS. Therefore, to ascertain whether the information received by an officer-in-charge of the police station makes out a cognizable offence, the officer must consider the meaning of the spoken or written words. This act on the part of the police officer will not amount to making a preliminary inquiry which is not permissible under sub-Section (1) of Section 173. Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  (iv) The police officers must abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals. The philosophy of the Constitution and its ideals can be found in the preamble itself"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,82,". The philosophy of the Constitution and its ideals can be found in the preamble itself. The preamble lays down that the people of India have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic and to secure all its citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. Therefore, liberty of thought and expression is one of the ideals of our Constitution. Article 19(1)(a) confers a fundamental right on all citizens to freedom of speech and expression. The police machinery is a part of the State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. Moreover, the police officers being citizens, are bound to abide by the Constitution. They are bound to honour and uphold freedom of speech and expression conferred on all citizens. (v) Clause (2) of Article 19 of the Constitution carves out an exception to the fundamental right guaranteed under sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of Article 19"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,83,". If there is a law covered by clause (2), its operation remains unaffected by sub-clause (a) of clause (1). We must remember that laws covered by the clause (2) are protected by way of Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  an exception provided they impose a reasonable restriction. Therefore, when an allegation is of the commission of an offence covered by the law referred to in clause (2) of Article 19, if sub- Section (3) of Section 173 is applicable, it is always appropriate to conduct a preliminary inquiry to ascertain whether a prima facie case is made out to proceed against the accused. This will ensure that the fundamental rights guaranteed under sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of Article 19 remain protected. Therefore, in such cases, the higher police officer referred to in sub- Section (3) of Section 173 must normally grant permission to the police officer to conduct a preliminary inquiry"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,84,". (vi) When an offence punishable under Section 196 of BNS is alleged, the effect of the spoken or written words will have to be considered based on standards of reasonable, strong-minded, firm and courageous individuals and not based on the standards of people with weak and oscillating minds. The effect of the spoken or written words cannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position. Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  (vii) There is no absolute rule that when the investigation is at a nascent stage, the High Court cannot exercise its jurisdiction to quash an offence by exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or under Section 482 of the CrPC equivalent to Section 528 of the BNSS"
Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,85,". When the High Court, in the given case, finds that no offence was made out on the face of it, to prevent abuse of the process of law, it can always interfere even though the investigation is at the nascent stage. It all depends on the facts and circumstances of each case as well as the nature of the offence. There is no such blanket rule putting an embargo on the powers of the High Court to quash FIR only on the ground that the investigation was at a nascent stage. (viii) Free expression of thoughts and views by individuals or group of individuals is an integral part of a healthy civilised society. Without freedom of expression of thoughts and views, it is impossible to lead a dignified life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.

Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025 – Supreme Court Judgment.pdf,87,". There is no other institution which can uphold the fundamental rights of the citizens. (ix) 75 years into our republic, we cannot be seen to be so shaky on our fundamentals that mere recital of a poem or for that matter, any form of art or entertainment, such as, stand-up comedy, can be alleged to lead to animosity or hatred amongst different communities. Subscribing to Criminal Appeal No.1545 of 2025  such a view would stifle all legitimate expressions of view in the public domain which is so fundamental to a free society. 43. Though this judgment is authored by one of us (Abhay S. Oka, J.), it is based on valuable inputs by Ujjal Bhuyan, J. 44. In the circumstances, the impugned order deserves to be set aside.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,5,". This flows from the duty of the State to protect and promote human rights. The role of the police in India is especially significant in this regard. The police are oath-bound to act strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law. As the first agency of contact in the criminal justice system, the police have the duty to ensure that the fundamental rights to equality before the law, the gamut of rights on arrest and detention, and the freedom of speech, expression and peaceful assembly are guaranteed. Exigencies and realities of operational policing can sometimes conflict with human rights; and rights protection depends heavily on police having the instinct and knowledge to balance these conflicts"

The Supreme Court of India has over the years explained and expanded the scope of Fundamental Rights in the realm of criminal justice; and has pronounced landmark judgments that lay down the scope of those rights, limits on policing powers, directions for the police, and remedies for victims of rights abuses, all towards stronger compliance with human rights standards. This handbook explains 26 landmark judgments of the Supreme Court that articulate the constitutional standard of Fundamental Rights of persons within the criminal justice system when they come in conflict with policing powers, and the specific laws, principles, and guidelines laid down by the Court.

OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS., AIR 2014 SC 187 (A Judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India) The duty of the police to mandatorily register an FIR for the commission of a cognizable offence Brief Facts The father of a kidnapped minor girl approached the Supreme Court over the failure of the police to initially register an First Information Report (FIR) and then after the FIR had been registered, to conduct a proper investigation and find her.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,14,". However, this failure of the police to register FIRs in this and several other cases was referred to a Constitutional Bench on the following issues. Issues for consideration 1. Is it mandatory for the police to register a First Information Report (FIR) under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19732, upon receiving any information relating to commission of a cognizable offence? Or do they have the power to conduct a ‘preliminary inquiry’ before registering the FIR, in order to test the credibility of such information? The Court noted that there were conflicting decisions on this issue, and some judgments had interpreted Section 154 as giving discretionary power to the police to conduct a “preliminary inquiry” before registering the FIR. This allowed the police to determine whether the complaint/first information was genuine, so as to prevent unnecessary harassment of the accused. 2"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,15,". 2. Whether the non-registration of the FIR immediately on receiving a complaint, creates scope for manipulation by the police that negatively affects the right of the victim/complainant to have their allegations investigated fairly? 3. Whether in cases where the complaint/information does not clearly disclose the commission of a cognizable offence but the FIR is registered, then does it infringe the rights of an accused? 2 Section 154. Information in cognizable cases- (1) Every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him or under his direction, and be read over to the informant; and every such information, whether given in writing or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the person giving it, and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf. .."

(2) A copy of the information as recorded under sub- section (1) shall be given forthwith, free of cost, to the informant. (3) Any person, aggrieved by a refusal on the part of an officer in charge of a police station to record the information referred to in Sub-Section (1) may send the substance of such information, in writing and by post, to the Superintendent of Police concerned who, if satisfied that such information discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, shall either investigate the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by any police officer subordinate to him, in the manner provided by this Code, and such officer shall have all the powers of an Officer-in-Charge of the police station in relation to that offence. 3 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS Observations by the Court Registration of an FIR was the first step of the right of the victim of a crime to access justice. Non- registration of FIRs contributed to societal lawlessness"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,17,". Non- registration of FIRs contributed to societal lawlessness. The use of the word “shall” in Section 154(1) implied that it was mandatory for the police to register an FIR if the information/complaint given to it disclosed a cognizable offence3. The police had no option/discretion to refuse to register an FIR, even if the information was not credible or reasonable. The first information disclosing a cognizable offence had to be recorded in an FIR book (also called ‘FIR register’) and must bear a unique number for the police station it was registered in. Addressing the concern that this mandatory requirement would be used to harass persons by registering false FIRs against them, the Court observed that if the police felt that the complaint/first information was not genuine, it could conduct a fair investigation, and file a final report to close the case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,18,". However, the Court also created an exception to this rule of mandatory registration of FIRs for a small category of cases, where a ‘preliminary inquiry’ by the police was allowed before registration of the FIR. These fall in 5 categories mentioned in paragraph 6 below. However, the Court ruled that even in such cases, the preliminary inquiry could be conducted only to determine whether there was a cognizable offence or not, and had to be concluded within 7 days. Directives of the Supreme Court (1) Registration of FIR is mandatory under Section 154 of the Code, if the information discloses commission of a cognizable offence and no preliminary inquiry is permissible in such a situation. (2) If the information received does not disclose a cognizable offence but indicates the necessity for an inquiry, a preliminary inquiry may be conducted only to ascertain whether cognizable offence is disclosed or not"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,19,". (3) If the inquiry discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, the FIR must be registered. In cases where preliminary inquiry ends in closing the complaint, a copy of the entry of such closure must be supplied to the first informant forthwith and not later than one week. It must disclose reasons in brief for closing the complaint and not proceeding further. (4) The police officer cannot avoid his duty of registering offence if cognizable offence is disclosed. Action must be taken against erring officers who do not register the FIR if information received by him discloses a cognizable offence. (5) The scope of preliminary inquiry is not to verify the veracity or otherwise of the information received but only to ascertain whether the information reveals any cognizable offence. (6) As to what type and in which cases preliminary inquiry is to be conducted will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,20,". The category of cases in which preliminary inquiry may be made are as under: a) Matrimonial disputes/family disputes b) Commercial offences 3 Although defined narrowly under Section 2(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a “cognizable offence” is a category of offence for which the police has the power to register an FIR, investigate or arrest a person without obtaining a warrant from a Magistrate. This is distinct from a non-cognizable offence, defined under Section 2(l), for which the police require a warrant from the Magistrate to do as above. All offences under the IPC or any other penal law are categorised as cognizable or non-cognizable by the legislature. 4 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA c) Medical negligence cases d) Corruption cases e) Cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over 3 months delay in reporting the matter without satisfactorily explaining the reasons for delay"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,21,". (7) The aforesaid are only illustrations and not exhaustive of all conditions which may warrant preliminary inquiry. (8) While ensuring and protecting the rights of the accused and the complainant, a preliminary inquiry should be made time bound and in any case it should not exceed 7 days. The fact of such delay and the causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary entry. (9) Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is the record of all information received in a police station, we direct that all information relating to cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration of FIR or leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily and meticulously reflected in the said Diary and the decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be reflected, as mentioned above"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,22,". Developments in the Law The important issue of territorial jurisdiction to register and investigate FIRs did not come up in Lalitha Kumari, although it is crucial to any discussion regarding registration of FIRs. In Satvinder Kaur v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi)4, the Supreme Court held that the police have a duty to register an FIR into a cognizable offence even if the offence had been committed inside the territorial jurisdiction of a different police station. In such a situation, the FIR should be forwarded to the correct police station having jurisdiction to investigate that offence, commonly referred to as a ‘zero FIR’. It was also held that if an offence was committed in multiple jurisdictions, then the police of any of those jurisdictions could register an FIR and investigate the case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,23,". In 2015, the Ministry of Home Affairs also issued a national advisory for mandatory registration of FIRs for commission of cognizable offences and registration of zero FIRs for offences committed outside jurisdiction.5 However, in Navinchandra N. Majithia v. State of Maharashtra & Ors.6, the Supreme Court warned against the misuse of the above position to harass persons by registering FIRs against them in remote places, unconnected to the offence. In 2013, non-registration of FIRs by a public servant in cases of gender-based crimes against women was made a punishable offence, punishable upto 2 years imprisonment.7 4 AIR 1999 SC 3596 4 Advisory dated 12.10.2015, as accessed on https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/AdvisoryFIR-290513.pdf 5 AIR 2000 SC 2966 6 Section 166A"

Brief Facts The father of a deceased Major in the Indian Army who had died under suspicious circumstances approached the Supreme Court. He contended that his son had been murdered, but the case was wrongly being treated as one of suicide by the local police. Thus, he was aggrieved and dissatisfied by the investigation into the death of his son, and prayed that the case be transferred to the CBI for investigation"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,26,". Issues for consideration Did a victim/complainant who was aggrieved by poor or improper investigation being conducted by the police in their case, have any legal recourse to ensure a proper investigation? Observations by the Court Under Section 156(3) CrPC8, a Magistrate had the power to direct the registration of an FIR on the asking of an aggrieved complainant/victim, to initiate the process of the law and safeguard their rights. Thus, if the police was illegitimately refusing to register an FIR, the complainant/victim could approach the Magistrate to direct the police to register it. Yet, there was no provision in the CrPC which gave a Magistrate the power to direct the course of investigation. In fact, under law, investigation was solely the domain of the police, and the judiciary could not interfere in it"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,27,". Thus, in the absence of such an explicit power under the CrPC, how could the Magistrate ensure a proper investigation? To overcome this, the Supreme Court invoked the ‘doctrine of implied power’. This doctrine stated that when a power is given to an authority to do something, it includes such incidental or implied powers which would ensure the proper doing of that thing. Therefore, applied to this situation, it would mean that since the Magistrate had the power to ensure the registration of FIR under Section 156(3), they also had the ‘implied power’ to ensure a proper investigation once that FIR was registered. Thus, using the doctrine of implied power, a Magistrate could ensure that a proper investigation is conducted into the grievances of the complainant/victim. This could take the form of monitoring of the investigation by the Magistrate to ensure that the police was performing its duty and conducting a proper investigation"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,28,". So in cases where the Magistrate felt that the police had not performed its duty of investigating the case at all, or had not performed it satisfactorily, s/he could issue a direction to the police to conduct the investigation properly, and could also monitor it. 8 Section 156. Police officer’s power to investigate cognizable case. (1) Any officer in charge of a police station may, without the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case which a Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII. (2) No proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under this section to investigate. (3) Any Magistrate empowered under section 190 may order such an investigation as above- mentioned"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,29,". (3) Any Magistrate empowered under section 190 may order such an investigation as above- mentioned. 6 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA Thus, laying out the entire process to be adopted by an aggrieved complainant/victim in case of failure by the police to register an FIR, the Court stated that such person could first approach the Superintendent of Police under Section 154(3) CrPC9 seeking registration of an FIR, by an application in writing. If the FIR was still not registered, the person could approach the Ilaqa/Area Magistrate in an application under Section 156(3) CrPC, for directions to the police to register the FIR. The Magistrate could also exercise its powers under Section 156(3) to “monitor” the investigation to ensure that it was being carried out properly by the police"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,30,". It was also noted that though the general rule was that a Magistrate could not interfere with the investigation being conducted by the police, this rule did not apply to cases where the investigation was not being conducted properly. Thus, Sakiri Vasu walks a tightrope: providing a victim the right to seek a proper investigation by the police through Magisterial supervision, but without interfering with the police’s domain over investigations, or colouring the outcome of the investigation with the opinion of the Magistrate which is not allowed under the law10. Directions of the Court A Magistrate, in exercise of the power under Section 156(3) CrPC, can not only direct the police to register an FIR and investigate a case, but can also monitor or oversee the investigation and ensure that it is being conducted in a fair and proper manner. 9 Section 154"

ANTONY v STATE OF KERALA, AIR 2001 SC 2637 (A Judgment of the Division Bench of the Supreme Court of India) Only the earliest or the first information in regard to the commission of a cognizable offence should be registered as an FIR"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,33,". There cannot be a second FIR or a fresh investigation based on every subsequent information in respect of the same cognizable offence or the same occurrence or incident giving rise to one or more cognizable offences. Brief Facts In the year 1994, in the backdrop of a political conflict between a sitting Minister of the Government of Kerala, and members of Communist Party of India (Marxist), his former political party, two incidents of violence took place on the same day. In both incidents, the police fired at members of CPI(M) and its affiliated organisations, who had gathered to protest the visit of the Minister, killing 5 persons. Subsequently, two FIRs were registered by the police for the two incidents in the same police station i.e. Kuthuparamba, district Kannur, against known and unknown protestors. Public uproar followed, and a Commission of Inquiry was constituted into the incidents of police firing"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,34,". The Commission of Inquiry concluded that the Minister, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, and the Deputy Collector were responsible for the firing by the police. As a consequence, a third FIR for murder was registered at the same police station against the above three persons, in which several other police officials were also implicated later. They sought the quashing of this third FIR before the High Court of Kerala but failed. Thus, they approached the Supreme Court. Issues for consideration Though the case involved many legal issues, the Supreme Court framed the following issue regarding registration of a second FIR for the same incident. Whether registration of a new case, which is in the nature of the second FIR under Section 154 of CrPC, is valid and can it form the basis of a fresh investigation? Observations by the Court The police had the duty to record the ‘first information’ received by it regarding a cognizable offence, and register an FIR"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,35,". This set the criminal law into motion, leading to an investigation into the alleged offence on the basis of the powers of the police under Sections 156 and 157, CrPC. However, there may be situations where more than one ‘information’ is given to the police in respect of the same incident, after an FIR has already been registered based on the very first information. In those situations, any subsequent information should not be recorded as a separate FIR, but should be considered statements received in the investigation of the first FIR itself. The registration of a second FIR for the same incident was against the scheme of the CrPC. 8 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA In a situation where during the investigation of an FIR, more offences were discovered by the police, they should add those offences in the first FIR itself, instead of registering another FIR. Similarly, if there was a change in the suspects/accused during the investigation, a new FIR should not be registered"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,36,". Even after the completion of investigation and filing of a charge sheet, if the police gather further information or material, a new FIR need not be registered, and instead further investigation can be conducted in the first FIR, normally with the permission of the court, under Section 173(8) of the CrPC11. Thus, only the earliest information about the commission of a cognizable offence has to be recorded as the ‘first information’ and a second FIR cannot be registered on receipt of a subsequent information. Accordingly, it quashed the FIR for murder registered against the three persons. It should be clarified that this did not mean that the three persons were exonerated by the Court, but only that their involvement in the incident, including the allegations of murder, had to be investigated as part of the earlier FIR, instead of registering a new or subsequent FIR into the same incident"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,37,". Developments in the Law Although TT Antony is the landmark and authoritative judgment on the issue of a second FIR, the legal principle in TT Antony has evolved over time. For instance, if the incident in the second FIR was part of the ‘same transaction’ as the incident in the first FIR, a second FIR was not sustainable [Babubhai v State of Gujarat12]. Another instance was when the second FIR was a consequence/ fall-out/outcome of the incident that was the subject-matter of the first FIR [C. Muniappan v State of Tamil Nadu13]. However, there are some situations where the TT Antony principle does not apply, and two FIRs could be registered. For instance, when the two FIRs involved different but overlapping offences [Ram Lal Narang v State (Delhi Administration)14]. Another situation where a second FIR is permissible was where there were cross-complaints filed by opposite parties to an incident"

A third situation was where the investigation of an FIR led to the discovery of a new crime of greater scope [Nirmal Singh Kahlon v State of Punjab17].

Observations by the Court The Court recognized that the right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India of a person accused in a criminal case, could not be realised unless they had access to the FIR registered against them, and they were able to take steps vital to protecting their rights. Thus, uploading of all FIRs was required to be made mandatory, except in some cases where the offence was of a sensitive nature, such as sexual offences, sexual offences against minors, insurgency, or terrorism. In such cases, the accused could approach the Superintendent/ Commissioner of Police for the FIR, who had to constitute a three-member committee to decide whether it could be provided to the accused or not. In case of denial, the accused could approach the court for a copy of the FIR"

(1) An accused is entitled to get a copy of the FIR at an earlier stage than as prescribed under Section 207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure18. (2) Accused with reasons to suspect that they have been roped in a criminal case and have been named as an accused in an FIR, can submit an application through their representative/ agent/parokar for grant of a certified copy of the FIR, to the concerned police officer or to the Superintendent of Police on payment of such fee which is payable for obtaining such a copy from the Court.

(3) Once the FIR is forwarded by the police station to the concerned Magistrate or any Special Judge, on an application being filed for certified copy on behalf of the accused, it shall be given by the Court concerned within two working days. The aforesaid direction has nothing to do with the statutory mandate inherent under Section 207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (4) The copies of the FIRs should be uploaded on the police website, unless the offence is sensitive in nature, like sexual offences, offences pertaining to insurgency, terrorism and of that category, 18 The stage of Section 207 CrPC is known as the stage of ‘supply of documents’.

In the case of states where the District Magistrate has a role, they may also assume the said authority. A decision taken by the concerned police officer or the District Magistrate shall be duly communicated to the concerned jurisdictional Magistrate.

(7) If an FIR is not uploaded, needless to say, it shall not ensure per se a ground to obtain the benefit of pre-arrest/anticipatory under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (8) In case a copy of the FIR is not provided on the ground of the sensitive nature of the case, a person grieved by the said action, after disclosing their identity, can submit a representation to the Superintendent of Police or any person holding the equivalent post in the State. The Superintendent of Police shall constitute a committee of three officers which shall deal with the said grievance. As far as the Metropolitan cities are concerned, where the Commissioner is there, if a representation is submitted to the Commissioner of Police who shall constitute a committee of three officers.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,50,". The existence of the power to arrest is one thing. The justification for the exercise of it is quite another. The police officer must be able to justify the arrest apart from his power to do so.” Brief Facts A young lawyer was called to the police station by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Ghaziabad, along with his brothers, to make enquiries from them in a criminal case. After the enquiry, his brothers were let go, but the Petitioner was illegally detained by the police. The next day, his family was informed that instead of being produced before a Magistrate, he had been taken to another police station.

During the hearing of the writ petition, the Petitioner was produced by the police before the Supreme Court, and the police claimed that he had never been detained, but had merely been cooperating with the police in the investigation of a case. Issues for consideration How does a court strike a balance between the expanding horizon of human rights, and the need to arrest persons at a time when crime rates are expanding? Observations by the Court The Court noted that the law on arrest in India tried to balance the rights, liberties and privileges of the accused, a single individual, with those of the society, a collection of individuals. However, as stated in the Third Report of the National Police Commission, the power to arrest was one of the chief sources of corruption in India and nearly 60 percent of the arrests made in India were either unnecessary or unjustified"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,52,". Such arrests or detentions caused incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person and violated their rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Thus, the Court held that although the police had the unquestionable legal powers to arrest a person in a cognizable criminal case, every arrest had to be justified. Arrests could not be made in a routine manner, merely on an allegation or a suspicion of their involvement in a crime. Every arrest should be made after the police officer reached a reasonable satisfaction after some investigation that the complaint was genuine and bona fide, the accused was complicit in the crime, and the arrest was necessary and justified. Developments in the Law The power of arrest is discretionary, and had to be done with caution and not mechanically. It was not necessary for the police to arrest the accused in every case, as held in M.C. Abraham v State of Maharashtra22"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,53,".C. Abraham v State of Maharashtra22. Most importantly, even a court, including a High Court, could not direct the police to arrest an accused as it was unjustified interference in the investigation. 21 A writ of habeas corpus is used to bring a detainee, arrestee, or prisoner before the court to determine if the person’s detention, arrest, or imprisonment is lawful. 22 (2003) 2 SCC 649 15 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS In Arnesh Kumar v State of Bihar23, dealing the power of arrest of the police in cases with offences punishable upto seven years, the Supreme Court noted that the amended Section 41(1)(b) CrPC24 required the police officer to arrest only after satisfaction of certain conditions as stipulated in the provision. The Court held that the law required the police officer to decide whether arrest was really required in the case and the purpose it would achieve. Thus, every arrest had to be based on justifiable reasons. 23 AIR 2014 SC 2756 24 Section 41"

Can the right to life of a citizen be put in abeyance on his arrest? These questions touch the spinal court of human rights jurisprudence. The answer, indeed, has to be an emphatic ‘No’.” Brief Facts The Petitioner, the Executive Chairman of Legal Aid Services, West Bengal, addressed a letter to the Chief Justice of India drawing his attention to certain news items published in the newspapers - the Telegraph, the Statesman and the Indian Express - regarding deaths in police lock-ups and in custody"

He urged for an in-depth examination of this issue, particularly the need to create mechanisms for accountability of police officials trying to hush up custodial violence, and frame guidelines to award compensation to victims/family members of victims of atrocities and custodial deaths. The Supreme Court treated this letter as a writ petition, regarding incidents of custodial violence not just in the state of West Bengal, but all over the country. Issues for consideration The petition raised fundamental issues concerning the use and abuse of police powers, and of developing mechanisms to prevent custodial torture and abuse of powers by police officials and other law enforcement officers. It also considered whether monetary compensation should be awarded for established infringement of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution of India"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,59,". Observations by the Court Under the Constitution of India, arrested and imprisoned persons were guaranteed various crucial Fundamental Rights. Under Article 20(3), they had the right against self-incrimination during police interrogations. Under Article 21, a guarantee against torture by the state, and under Article 22, the multiple rights against unlawful detention beyond 24 hours without production before a Magistrate, against arrest or detention without being informed the grounds of arrest, and representation by a legal practitioner of choice. After asserting the above protections, the Court noted provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure, aimed at providing procedural safeguards to arrestees by regulating the power of the police during and after arrest. For instance, the police’s power to arrest (Section 41), the method and manner of arrest (Section 46), the extent of restraint by the police permissible against the arrestee (Section 49), and others"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,60,". Thus, powers of arrest of the police were not limitless, but governed by provisions of the Constitution and the CrPC. However, there was growth in incidents of torture and deaths in judicial custody despite these rights and procedural safeguards. This rise in the number of custodial violence cases had been noted in the Third Report of the National Police Commission. The Court expressed strong condemnation of custodial violence used by policing agencies, as a violation of basic human rights of persons, and its negative impact on the Rule of Law and the criminal justice system. Touching upon the issue of the difficulty in prosecuting police officials for custodial crimes, the Court noted that in cases of custodial death or torture especially within police stations, the police failed to follow even basic processes of criminal procedure"

Rather than registering an FIR, they acted to conceal or destroy evidence, and manipulate the records of the police station to hide culpability 17 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS of police officials. To overcome this, the Court recommended lowering the strict adherence to the standard of “proof beyond reasonable doubt” in cases of prosecution of police officials for custodial crimes, by lowering the bar of proving the offence in custodial violence prosecutions. It also reiterated the recommendation of the 113th Report of the Law Commission of India to insert Section 114B in the Indian Evidence Act to include a presumption that if a person suffered an injury while being in police custody, it was caused by the police official. This would place the burden on the police to show how the person suffered the injury, if not at their hands"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,62,".25 A lot of emphasis was also placed on the broader goal of introducing mechanisms for making arrests more transparent and the police more accountable for violations of rights. The Court even suggested introducing a structure of appropriate machinery for contemporaneous recording and notification of all cases of arrest and detention. Lastly, it issued a number of requirements/guidelines to be followed in all cases of arrests and detentions as preventive measures, through which the Court sought to fill up the legislative gap in this respect. Directives by the Supreme Court (1) The police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate, visible and clear identification and name tags with their designations. The particulars of all such police personnel who handle interrogation of the arrestee must be recorded in a register"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,63,". (2) That the police officer carrying out the arrest of the arrestee shall prepare a memo of arrest at the time of arrest and such memo shall be attested by at least one witness, who may be either a member of the family of the arrestee or a respectable person of the locality from where the arrest is made. It shall also be counter signed by the arrestee and shall contain the time and date of arrest. (3) A person who has been arrested or detained and is being held in custody in a police station or interrogation center or other lock-up, shall be entitled to have one friend or relative or other person known to him or having interest in his welfare being informed, as soon as practicable, that he has been arrested and is being detained at the particular place, unless the attesting witness of the memo of arrest is himself such a friend or a relative of the arrestee"

(4) The time, place of arrest and venue of custody of an arrestee must be notified by the police where the next friend or relative of the arrestee lives outside the district or town through the Legal Aid Organisation in the District and the police station of the area concerned telegraphically within a period of 8 to 12 hours after the arrest. (5) The person arrested must be made aware of this right to have someone informed of his arrest or detention as soon as he is put under arrest or is detained. (6) An entry must be made in the diary at the place of detention regarding the arrest of the person which shall also disclose the name of the next friend of the person who has been informed of the arrest and the names and particulars of the police officials in whose custody the arrestee is. (7) The arrestee should, where he so requests, be also examined at the time of his arrest and major and minor injuries, if any present on his/her body, must be recorded at that time"

Failure to comply with the requirements hereinabove mentioned shall apart from rendering the concerned official liable for departmental action, also render him liable to be punished for contempt of court and the proceedings for contempt of court may be instituted in any High Court of the country, having territorial jurisdiction over the matter.

These requirements are in addition to the constitutional and statutory safeguards, and do not detract from various other directions given by the courts from time to time in connection with the safeguarding of the rights and dignity of the arrestee. Developments in the Law Even before DK Basu, in Sheela Barse v State of Maharashtra26, the Supreme Court had passed very specific directions regarding the rights of female arrestees - keeping female suspects in separate lock ups from men within the police station, guarded by female Constables, and interrogated only in the presence of female police officials. It also passed crucial general directions for arrestees, that were reiterated and cemented in DK Basu. DK Basu has become the most consequential judgment on Articles 21 and 22 rights of arrestees. Its critical influence was reinforced by the multiple amendments made in the CrPC incorporating many of the directives/guidelines/requirements issued by the Court"

For instance requirements 1 26 AIR 1983 SC 378 19 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS to 3, 5, and 6 regarding the procedure for arrest were partially incorporated in Sections 41B and 50A that came into effect in 2010. Similarly, the directive for medical examination of the arrested person (8) was incorporated into the amended Section 54, the right to consult a lawyer of choice (10) in Section 41D, and the setting up of control rooms (11) in Section 41C. The case has continued to run since then, and the issues before the Court have also evolved over time. For instance, in 2015, the Court directed State Governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura, Nagaland, and Delhi, to set up State Human Rights Commissions under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,69,". It held that the lack of state commissions, especially in the north-eastern states which were situated far away from the seat of the National Human Rights Commission in Delhi, effectively meant a denial of access to this redressal mechanism for violation of human rights, and so a denial of the right to access justice itself. The Court also directed state governments to consider setting up human rights courts, for trying offences arising out of violation of human rights. In 2020, the Amicus Curiae in this case moved the Supreme Court for revival of the DK Basu case in light of incidents of custodial deaths in 2020 of a father-son duo in Tamil Nadu, and the alleged encounter death of a gangster in Uttar Pradesh. In Paramvir Singh Saini v Baljit Singh & Ors27, as a measure to curb custodial violence in police stations, the Supreme Court directed all State/UT governments to install CCTV cameras and provide all supporting facilities to cover every part of every police station in India"

The Central Government has to install CCTV cameras in the interrogation and holding rooms of investigating agencies under its control such as the Criminal Bureau of Investigation and the National Investigation Agency.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,71,".” Brief Facts In 1980, in an infamous incident of brutal custodial torture and violence against undertrials, jail officials blinded several men lodged at Bhagalpur Central Jail by pouring acid into their eyes. This has since been known as the ‘Bhagalpur blindings incident’. Afterwards, when those undertrials were produced before Judicial Magistrates for remand proceedings for the first time after their blinding, most were not represented by any lawyer. Even the Magistrates did not offer them any legal representation at State cost, supposedly for the reason that they had not asked for it. Due to this lack of legal representation, most of them continued to languish in jail despite being subjected to custodial torture and violence. Issues for consideration Ensuring the right to free legal representation for the poor and indigent at state expense was one of the principal issues before the Court in this case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,72,". Observations by the Court The right to free legal services was an essential ingredient of ‘reasonable, just and fair’ procedure (in a reference to Maneka Gandhi v Union of India28) for the person accused of an offence, and was implicit in the Article 21 right to life and liberty. Thus, right to legal representation was a Fundamental Right under the Constitution of India. In furtherance, the State has a constitutional mandate to provide a lawyer to an accused who was unable to afford one on their own. Yet, most States in the country had not ensured free legal services for accused persons. The argument of ‘financial constraints’ raised by the state as a reason to deny free legal representation was also rejected"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,73,". Another important question that the Court dealt with was: when does this right to free legal representation arise? It was held that such right begins from the moment of the first production of the arrestee before the Magistrate, since this was the first opportunity for them to exercise their right to seek bail, or resist their remand at the hands of the police. It also held that judges were under an obligation to inform the accused about their right to obtain free legal services at state cost, if they could not afford it on their own. It noted the failure of the Magistrates in this regard when the blinded undertrials were produced before them. Developments in the Law In Madhav Hayawadanrao Hoskot v State of Maharashtra29 free legal aid to an accused was held to be an inalienable right of fair procedure, and was a fundamental constitutional directive of the state under Article 39A of the Constitution of India30"

In Mohammed Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab & Ors. v State of Maharashtra & Ors.32, it was held that it is the duty of the Magistrate to inform the accused that they had a right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner, and if they did not have a lawyer, it would be provided to them at state expense. Thus, the right to consult and be defended by a lawyer is a fundamental right under Article 22(1) of the Constitution33 and the law on this issue is undisputed. Yet, there are other related aspects of when and how that right is to be exercised in reality, that have continued to evolve over time. When does the right to access legal representation first arise? Different judgments have held differently. Khatri itself held that this right arose at the time of first production and this view has later been reinforced by Mohammed Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab. Sheela Barse advanced this to the time of arrest itself (which could be upto 24 hours before the first production)"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,76,". DK Basu v State of West Bengal34 held that arrestees should be permitted to meet their lawyer during interrogation, which could be anytime after arrest. However, even before all these judgments, Nandini Satpathy v PL Dani35 applied this right even before arrest, at the time of questioning itself.36 How is this right to be exercised, especially during questioning/interrogations? This is the most contentious question. In Nandini Satpathy, the Supreme Court drew inspiration from the right to access to a lawyer during interrogations as mandated by the United States Supreme Court in Miranda v Arizona37. It held that in protection of the Article 20(3) right against self-incrimination, the access to a lawyer during interrogation is essential, and the lawyer should be allowed to be present at the time of their examination"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,77,". This was not only to prevent possible right violations if Investigating Officers posed self-incriminating questions contrary to the Article 20(3) protection; but also to intercept any intimidation or any other tactic by the police to obtain incriminating statements. However, the lawyer could not answer or supply answers to the questioned person or otherwise interfere with the questioning itself. But Mohammed Ajmal Mohammad Amir Kasab disagreed with Nandini Satpathy and held that this right is not to be construed as permitting a lawyer to be present during interrogations. DK Basu has taken a middle path - that an arrestee may be permitted to meet his lawyer during interrogation, though not throughout the interrogation. A very crucial judgment of the Bombay High Court in Cecilia Fernandes v State38 underlined the importance of privacy of consultation of an arrestee with their lawyer"

The right to legal representation applies not just during interrogations or court proceedings, but also to accused in jail. For such an accused, consultation with their lawyer is by booking legal interviews through a procedure under the prison rules of the state, and this procedure had to be reasonable, just, and fair39 as held in Francis Coralie Mullin v Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi40. Any impractical, inconvenient or unreasonable procedures to book legal interviews with prisoners would obstruct and thus violate Articles 14 and 21, and the right to legal representation"

This was despite their protests about the torture and humiliation implicit in handcuffing. This also violated the directions of the Supreme Court in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration & Ors"

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,82,". Issues for consideration Balancing the need to deter the escape of a prisoner with the need to preserve their dignity, the Court considered the following issues: Can the custodian fetter the person of the prisoner, while in transit, with irons, maybe handcuffs or chains or bar fetters? When does such traumatic treatment break into the inviolable zone of guaranteed rights? When does disciplinary measure end and draconic torture begin? What are the constitutional parameters, viable guidelines and practical strategies which will permit the peaceful co-existence of custodial conditions and basic dignity? Thus, in this case, the Court was investigating deeper issues of rights of prisoners against custodial cruelty and infliction of indignity within the human rights parameters of Fundamental Rights"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,83,". Observations by the Court The Court started by recognising the absence of any clear ‘detention jurisprudence’ in India, the pragmatic consideration of preventing escape attempts, and the need to respect the dignity of the prisoner when it came to handcuffing. Touching upon international law, in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 194842, and Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 196643, there was a recognition that persons did not lose their right to treatment with dignity and humanity merely due to their prisoner status. The Court also referred to Maneka Gandhi v Union of India44 and its expansive interpretation that even procedural rights of persons had to be “fair, just and reasonable” and satisfy the rigour of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India, as held in Sunil Batra"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,84,". Thus, applied to prisoners, Article 14 prevented their arbitrary, discriminatory and cruel treatment, Article 19 prescribed restrictions on free movement unless in the interests of the general public, and Article 21 prescribed fair procedure and forbade barbaric and punitive treatment. Applying these principles to the issue of handcuffing, the Court held that handcuffing was prima facie inhuman and unreasonable, was overly harsh and punitive, and appeared to be imposed 41 AIR 1980 SC 1579 42 No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 43 All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person. 44 AIR 1978 SC 597 24 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA arbitrarily by the police and prisons. In the absence of a fair procedure for handcuffing, and without objective monitoring of its use, handcuffing would violate the fundamental rights of prisoners"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,85,". Preventing the escape of a prisoner was certainly in the public interest, but it could not be done in a way that caused mental or physical torture to the prisoner. Thus, the Court held that handcuffs or other fetters shall not ordinarily be forced on an undertrial prisoner. It was implicit in Articles 14 and 19 that when there was no compulsive need to fetter a person’s limbs, doing so was arbitrary and thus violative of Article 14, and violated the freedom of movement under Article 19. Handcuffing should only be used in cases where there was a well- grounded basis that the prisoner might attempt to escape, and there was no other reasonable way of preventing it. Alternative methods of preventing escape should also be developed to reduce reliance on handcuffing, such as having a few more police guards to accompany the prisoner"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,86,". The Court also ruled that the practice of deciding which prisoners to handcuff on the basis of their economic or social status, as laid down in the Punjab Police Rules45, was illegal. Socio-economic class was not a measure of a person’s likelihood of escape. Such a system of classification was elitist. Nor was the seriousness of the offence a person was accused of as a determining factor, since they may not be of a violent character or attempt to escape. Only tangible testimony, documentary or otherwise, be a vital ground for handcuffing or fettering, and even this could be avoided by increasing the number of accompanying prison police personnel. For extreme cases where handcuffs absolutely had to be put on the prisoner, the Court held that the escorting authority had to contemporaneously record the reasons for doing so, otherwise, such procedure would be unfair and bad in law, under Article 21"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,87,". It also cautioned against the recording of reasons to be a mechanical and mindless process. The escorting officer must show the reasons for handcuffing to the Presiding Judge and get their judicial approval, and in the absence of such approval, no escorting authority could handcuff the person. Developments in the Law Even in the years following Prem Shankar Shukla, cases continued to emerge about the indiscriminate use of handcuffs against prisoners in violation of the Supreme Court’s directions. In such cases, the Supreme Court responded by gradually withdrawing the power from police and jail authorities to decide to handcuff a prisoner ‘handcuffs’, and vesting it in courts. For instance, in Sunil Gupta & Ors. v State Of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.46, the Court held that a person remanded to custody by a court was in judicial custody, and therefore, the taking of such person to and from court was only under the judicial orders of the court"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,88,". The final power of approval whether the reasons for handcuffing were justified or not was only with the court. In Citizens of Democracy v State of Assam & Ors.47, the Supreme Court went a step further. It clarified that the law and directions in the Sunil Batra and Prem Shankar Shukla judgments were binding on all authorities in India and any violation would attract the penal provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act as well as any other penal law applicable. It also withdrew the power of police or jail authorities to unilaterally impose handcuffing upon prisoners without obtaining permission from the Judge in the given case of the prisoner. Thus, a handcuff could only be inflicted on an undertrial prisoner after obtaining permission from the Judge. 45 The Punjab Police Rules also apply to the Delhi Police. 46 (1990) 3 SCC 119 47 (1995) 3 SCC 743 C.

The powerful processes of criminal law can then be perverted for achieving extraneous ends… That can even take the form of the parading of a respectable person in handcuffs, apparently on way to a court of justice. It is in order to meet such situations, though not limited to these contingencies, that the power to grant anticipatory bail was introduced into the Code of 1973.” Brief Facts The Petitioner was the Minister of Irrigation and Power in the Government of Punjab and was an accused in a case of political corruption. He filed an application in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,48 seeking his release on bail in case of his arrest in the case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,90,". The High Court rejected his application, stating several reasons, the principal one being that the power to grant ‘pre-arrest’ bail was an extraordinary discretionary power and must only be exercised in exceptional cases. It held that the Petitioner was accused of a serious economic offence involving high level corruption and thus, this discretionary power must not be exercised to his benefit. The High Court also added other principles regulating and limiting the scope of power of the court under Section 438, which were not part of the provision. The Petitioner approached the Supreme Court, and argued that since the provision did not itself contain any limitations on the use of the power of Section 438 by the court to grant ‘pre-arrest bail’, the High Court was not right in introducing such limitations. Even more so since the provision was created to protect personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,91,". Issues for consideration The provision for pre-arrest or ‘anticipatory bail’ in the CrPC was necessary to protect the personal liberty of persons, yet it had an impact on the investigative powers of the police. How were these two competing interests supposed to be balanced while exercising this power under Section 438? And were there any limitations in the power of the court under Section 438? 48 Section 438. Direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest. (1) When any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed a non- bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section; and that Court may, if it thinks fit, direct that in the event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,92,". (2) When the High Court or the Court of Session makes a direction under sub- section (1), it may include such conditions in such directions in the light of the facts of the particular case, as it may think fit, including- (i) a condition that the person shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required; (ii) a condition that the person shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer; (iii) a condition that the person shall not leave India without the previous permission of the Court; (iv) such other condition as may be imposed under sub- section (3) of section 437, as if the bail were granted under that section"

(3) If such person is thereafter arrested without warrant by an Officer-in-Charge of a police station on such accusation, and is prepared either at the time of arrest or at any time while in the custody of such officer to give bail, be shall be released on bail; and if a Magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that a warrant should issue in the first instance against that person, he shall issue a bailable warrant in conformity with the direction of the Court under sub- section (1). 27 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS Observations by the Court The old Code of Criminal Procedure of 1898, did not have any provision corresponding to Section 438 for pre-arrest/anticipatory bail. This was introduced in the new Code of Criminal Procedure when it was enacted in 1973, incorporating this suggestion from the 41st Report of the Law Commission of India49"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,94,". Under the Section 438 so added, a person could apply for bail to the High Court or the Court of Session in anticipation of their arrest, and hence the name ‘anticipatory bail’ was commonly used to refer to it. Normally, ‘bail’ was granted after a person had been arrested, and so ‘anticipatory bail’ was basically a direction to the police to immediately release the person on bail in a case if they were arrested. So while ‘bail’ was granted after arrest, ‘anticipatory bail’ was granted before arrest, to come into effect the moment the arrest took place in the future, to prevent the person from going into the custody of the police or to the jail. The purpose behind having this provision was to protect from arrest those persons targeted by the police for oblique purposes or motives, such as political antagonism or personal rivalry, even though they were innocent"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,95,". Since the arrest restricted their liberty, and even resulted in humiliations like being paraded in handcuffs on their way to court, it was important to have a provision such as ‘anticipatory bail’ to prevent these situations. Thus, on the question of whether the wide power to grant ‘anticipatory bail’ should be restricted or limited, the Court held that the legislature had added Section 438 in the new CrPC giving broad and unrestricted power to the court to grant anticipatory bail. Such a broadly worded provision should not generally be limited or constrained through judicial interpretation. This applied even more so to a provision like Section 438, which extended the principle of presumption of innocence by protecting persons from unwarranted arrests. Another reason for this conclusion was that in the CrPC, the power of courts to grant post-arrest bail50 had many limitations and qualifications, but pre-arrest anticipatory bail did not have any"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,96,". Instead, wide discretion had been given to the court to grant or deny anticipatory bail “if it thinks fit”. For instance, bail should normally not be given in cases punishable by imprisonment for life or death, but there was no such qualification for anticipatory bail. The only condition that the person seeking anticipatory bail had to meet was they had to show there was “reason to believe” that they may be arrested for a non-bailable offence, to show that the expectation of arrest was based on a reason and not merely an unfounded fear. The next logical question that came up before the Court was: How was this wide, discretionary power to be exercised by judges? It held that no formula can be devised to regulate the use of the power to grant anticipatory bail. That would be against the very spirit of the provision. The power had to be used by the court on a case by case basis, depending on the specific facts of every case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,97,". For instance, in cases where the allegations against a person were rooted in ulterior motives, whether to injure or humiliate that person by having them arrested, anticipatory bail should be granted. But if the person was one who, if they were given anticipatory bail, would flee from justice, or would not appear before the court when required, or influence witnesses, anticipatory bail should not be granted. Another consideration to deny anticipatory bail would be if it was in the larger public or state interest. The Court did warn against passing a “blanket” order of anticipatory bail that the person cannot be arrested for any case, because it could create an immunity for a person to carry out illegal activities. So an anticipatory bail should be specific to the offences/case for which it is effective. 49 41st Report of the Law Commission of India (The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898) as accessed on https:// lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/1-50/Report41"

If any court made an error of judgment and wrongly granted anticipatory bail, it could always be corrected by a superior court. In the end, the Court granted anticipatory bail to the Petitioner. Directives by the Court (1) Section 438(1), CrPC, lays down a condition which has to be satisfied before anticipatory bail can be granted. The applicant must show that they have “reason to believe” that they may be arrested for a non-bailable offence. This belief must be founded on reasonable grounds. Mere ‘fear’ is not ‘belief"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,99,". This belief must be founded on reasonable grounds. Mere ‘fear’ is not ‘belief. The grounds on which the belief of the applicant is based that they may be arrested for a non-bailable offence, must be capable of being examined by the court objectively. Section 438(1), therefore, cannot be invoked on the basis of vague and general allegations, as if to arm oneself in perpetuity against a possible arrest. Anticipatory bail is a device to secure the individual’s liberty; it is neither a passport to the commission of crimes nor a shield against any and all kinds of accusations, likely or unlikely. (2) If an application for anticipatory bail is made to the High Court or the Court of Session, it must apply its own mind to the question and decide whether a case has been made out for granting such relief. It cannot leave the question for the decision of the Magistrate concerned under Section 437 of the CrPC, as and when an occasion arises"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,100,". (3) The filing of an FIR is not a condition precedent to the exercise of the power under Section 438. The imminence of a likely arrest founded on a reasonable belief can be shown to exist even if an FIR is not yet filed. (4) Anticipatory bail can be granted even after an FIR is filed, so long as the applicant has not been arrested. (5) Section 438, being pre-arrest bail, cannot be invoked after the arrest of the accused. After arrest, the accused must seek their remedy under Section 437 or Section 439 of the CrPC. Developments in the Law Although the dismissal of the anticipatory bail means that the person does not have immunity from arrest, it does not necessarily imply that they must be arrested immediately, as held in MC Abraham & Anr. v State of Maharashtra51. The Supreme Court held that even while dismissing anticipatory bail applications, a court cannot direct the police to arrest the applicants"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,101,". Arrest of a person had to be based on legitimate grounds under the law, and could not be made on the direction of the court. Before granting or rejecting anticipatory bail, the court could also grant an interim bail, for a short duration. In Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre v State of Maharashtra52, the Supreme Court held that when an accused files for anticipatory bail before it, if the court is inclined to grant it, then an interim bail can be granted initially and notice can be issued to the public prosecutor. After hearing the public prosecutor, the court can either reject the application, or confirm the interim bail while imposing conditions. 51 (2003) 2 SCC 649 52 AIR 2011 SC 312 29 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS In Sushila Aggarwal v State (NCT of Delhi)53, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that anticipatory bails should ordinarily not be limited to a fixed period of time, and the life of anticipatory bail can continue till the end of the trial"

The Petitioner and the other accused had been arrested during the investigation of the case, and had been in custody for seven months. The Trial Court and the Delhi High Court rejected their bail applications, on several grounds. Firstly, due to the seriousness of the allegations against them that involved losses to the public exchequer ranging in several thousands of crores. Also, the volume of evidence collected against them, and the likely heavy sentence to be imposed on conviction. The possibility that they might use their power to influence witnesses, or abscond and not face trial. And finally, due to the strong opposition by the CBI to their bail. Thus, they approached the Supreme Court seeking bail. Issues for consideration The Court in this case was mainly concerned with the principles governing the grant of bail to undertrials in India, and what considerations should weigh in the mind of judges while considering bail applications"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,104,". Observations by the Court The Court asserted two core principles of criminal jurisprudence in India, the first being the presumption of innocence - that every person was deemed to be innocent until duly tried and found guilty. Thus, no matter what the allegations against an undertrial were, it could not be assumed that they had committed those crimes. And naturally, they should also not be punished for those alleged crimes till they had been convicted by a court of law, since it meant psychological and physical deprivation for the undertrial. Thus, pre-conviction imprisonment could and should not be ‘punitive’, meaning that an undertrial accused must not be denied bail to give them a ‘taste of imprisonment’. The Court also asserted a second principle - that granting bail to an undertrial was the rule and committing them to jail was the exception"

In determining how that discretion was to be exercised, the Court should consider whether the undertrial, if granted bail, would influence the witnesses, or abscond from justice and not stand trial when required. The gravity and heinousness of the crime should also be considered since there may be factors that induce an undertrial to avoid facing trial. The Court also looked at other factors that must be considered while deciding whether or not to grant bail since being in jail also negatively affected other rights of the person. For instance, undertrials on bail were better placed to defend themselves in their cases than those in jail. Community roots of undertrials must also be factored in while assessing whether they could be a flight risk"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,114,". The deplorable conditions in jails in India, delays in trials of cases, and the considerable public expenses involved in housing undertrials who were not even flight risks, were also factors that weigh on the side of grant of bail, rather than continued incarceration. Following these principles and applying them to this case, the Court rejected the argument of the prosecution that the seriousness or gravity of the allegations should by itself be a reason to deny bail. It held that the maximum punishment of the offences was seven years. The record of the case was voluminous and the trial was likely to take a long time. And since the investigation of the case was complete, their presence in custody was not required for investigative purposes either.

However, there are judgments, both preceding and subsequent to Sanjay Chandra, that limit its applicability to cases of serious economic offences, or where the maximum imposable sentence was greater than seven years, as was the case in Sanjay Chandra.

Many of these unfortunate men and women must not even be remembering when they entered the jail and for what offence?” Brief Facts A writ of habeas corpus60 was filed in the Supreme Court based on reports carried by the Indian Express newspaper in January 1979 about the state of poor undertrials in Bihar’s jails. Arguing that their continued imprisonment was illegal, the petition prayed for the release of men, women and even children, who had been lodged in jails as undertrials for long periods of time, sometimes over 10 years, often for trivial offences carrying minor punishments.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,120,". It considered the following issues: (1) The bail system under the CrPC suffered from an antiquated property oriented approach - that the risk of monetary loss was the only deterrent against undertrials fleeing from justice. This resulted in the requirement of the accused to furnish a ‘personal bond’61 as a condition for release on bail, in the form of a monetary obligation. (2) Courts mechanically insisted on solvent sureties/guarantors62 to stand bail for the accused, so as to be able to pay the bond amount in case the accused failed to appear in court. (3) This system operated very harshly against the poor, who found it difficult to furnish bail even without sureties, and especially difficult with them. This resulted in their inability to secure release from jail. Observations by the Court Struck by the undue detention of poor undertrials by the criminal justice system for years on end, the Supreme Court held that bail procedures in India had to satisfy the Maneka Gandhi v"

A procedure which kept such a large number of people behind bars without trial for so long could not be regarded as reasonable, just or fair so as to be in conformity with the requirement of Article 21. The Court pressed on the need for the law to radically change its approach to pretrial detention and ensure a ‘reasonable, just and fair’ procedure. It pushed for thorough reforms in the bail system to make pretrial release from jail accessible for the rich and the poor alike. After identifying the ‘property oriented approach’ as an unfair barrier for securing release from jail, the Court called for the introduction of newer approaches to ensure that undertrials do not flee 60 A writ of habeas corpus is used to bring a detainee, arrestee, or prisoner before the court to determine if the person’s detention, arrest, or imprisonment is lawful"

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,123,". Thus, after assessment, if the court was satisfied that the accused had ties in the community and there was no substantial risk of non-appearance, the accused could be released on a personal bond. Even while granting release on personal bond, the bond amount should not be set based merely on the nature/seriousness of the charge against the accused, but should be an individualised amount based on their financial circumstances and probability of absconding. Thus, the Court held that the requirement of financial solvency of the accused should not result in denial of bail and deprivation of personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution of India to poor and indigent persons. Developments in the Law The issue of onerous bail conditions, and how that results in denial of liberty for the accused has been a prevalent issue in India.

It also held that the surety produced by the accused does not have to be from the same district as where the court granting bail is situated. In Raghubir Singh & Ors. v State of Bihar65, the Supreme Court recognised that sometimes it may not be possible for an undertrial to furnish bail soon after the order is passed, for reasons including poverty, but they should not be deprived of the benefit of bail because of their inability to furnish bail bonds right away.

In Bhim Singh v Union of India67, the Supreme Court took note of Section 436A of the CrPC, which mandates the release of undertrials who have already spent half of the period of their maximum possible sentence68.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,128,". The expert opined that the two handwritings matched. The Trial Court convicted the Respondent and relied on the chit as one piece of evidence against him. The Respondent challenged his conviction before the High Court arguing that he had been compelled to give a specimen handwriting sample to the police during his custody. It was argued that this was a violation of Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India, referred to as the fundamental right against self-incrimination69. The High Court ruled that he had been compelled to give his handwriting sample, and therefore, the protection of Article 20(3) had been violated and acquitted him. Thus, the case came before the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. In a connected case that was heard along with this case, a similar issue arose. This is with respect to the forcible collection of specimen fingerprint and palm prints from the accused while he was in police custody during the investigation of that case. Issues for consideration 1"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,129,". Issues for consideration 1. What does it mean for a person to be ‘a witness against himself’ within the meaning of Article 20(3) of the Constitution? If an accused has been forced/compelled to give specimen handwritings during the investigation of a case, does that mean that they have been ‘compelled to be a witness against himself’? 2. Does the mere fact that the accused was in police custody when the specimen handwritings had been taken could by itself amount to compulsion? What other circumstances amounted to compelling a person to ‘be a witness against himself’? During the arguments in this case, two counter positions were argued by the opposite parties. The Petitioner/State of Bombay argued two things in favour of a limited or restricted interpretation of the Article 20(3) protection. Firstly, it argued that the expression ‘compelled to be a witness’ used in Article 20(3) should only mean being compelled to give ‘oral testimony’"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,130,". Therefore, a person could not be compelled to give oral testimony against himself, but could be compelled to produce 69 Article 20(3). No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. This fundamental right essentially means that a person cannot be compelled or forced to become a witness against themselves in a criminal case. Thus, any action of the police, where the evidence has been collected in violation of this fundamental right, would be unconstitutional and illegal. This right acts as a protection for an accused, making illegal, all evidence gathered or collected by violating it. 38 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA a document, exhibit or examine their body, or to take the specimen writing, thumb impression, impression of the palm or the feet or the fingers of an accused70. This compulsion would not violate Article 20(3)"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,131,". This compulsion would not violate Article 20(3). Secondly, it was argued that this protection of Article 20(3) was only available to an accused during court proceedings, not during investigation. On the other hand, the Respondent argued that Article 20(3) provided complete protection of the widest amplitude to an accused, irrespective of the time and place, or the nature of the evidence, whether it is oral, documentary, or material. It was also available not only during court proceedings, but also during investigation. Thus, any act, speech, production of document, or taking specimens from an accused, which is compelled, forcible, or non-voluntary, violated the Article 20(3) protection. Observations by the Court In order to address the issues in this case, the Court first discussed its earlier judgment in M.P. Sharma & Ors. v Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi71 which had also dealt with the right/ protection against self-incrimination under Article 20(3)"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,132,". In that case, the Supreme Court had gone into the origin and scope of the doctrine of protection against self-incrimination in English and American law. It had made two principle interpretations regarding the Article 20(3) protection in M.P. Sharma’s case. Firstly, the Court had concluded that the protection from being ‘compelled to be a witness against himself’ was bigger than merely being compelled to give oral testimony in a trial in which the accused admitted to their guilt, or said something that would become evidence in the prosecution’s case against them. Restricting Article 20(3) as applying only to oral testimony in a trial would wrongly limit the wide protection it offered to an accused. Secondly, it interpreted the expression ‘to become a witness’ to include giving evidence through lips, or by production of a thing or a document, or in other modes. Thus, according to M.P"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,133,". Thus, according to M.P. Sharma, every compelled act by the accused, whether spoken words or providing documents, was ‘to furnish evidence’ against himself, and therefore violated the Article 20(3) protection. Therefore, the Supreme Court began by analysing whether the above interpretation of Article 20(3) by the Supreme Court in M.P. Sharma’s case was correct. And if it was correct, did it also imply that compelled collection of handwriting, fingerprint, or palm print specimens from the accused also violated the Article 20(3) protection? The Court held that although the Article 20(3) protection did exclude compelled oral or written testimonies by the accused, it could not have been intended to also exclude thumb impression, specimen handwriting, etc, as that would create obstacles in the way of efficient and effective investigations by the police into crimes"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,134,". The Court also held that forcibly taking a person’s specimen handwriting or fingerprint for the purpose of comparison did not amount to being ‘compelled to be a witness against himself’ and did not violate Article 20(3). The reason was that an accused would ‘be a witness against himself’ if they were to testify to what they had seen or heard that would tend to incriminate them. However, the compelled production of documentary evidence in the possession of the accused, would not 70 These are bodily samples of the accused collected during the investigation usually to compare with evidence collected during the investigation, to determine whether the evidence could be connected to the accused. For example, evidence in the form fingerprints collected from a crime scene could be compared with the fingerprint specimens/samples collected from the accused during the investigation, to determine whether the accused was present at the scene of the crime"

Therefore, ‘being a witness against himself’‘ only meant conveying information based upon the accused’s personal knowledge, but did not include the mere mechanical process of producing documents in court which did not contain any statement of the accused based on their personal knowledge. Thus, applying these principles to the case, the Supreme Court held that the specimen handwriting or fingerprint of an accused was not their ‘personal testimony’, but were only materials for comparison. Therefore, compelling the accused to give these specimens, and using them in evidence against them, did not violate the Article 20(3) protection"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,136,". Another reasoning given by other judges was that compelling the accused to give these specimens may make them a witness, but not ‘against himself’ so as to violate Article 20(3). This was because the specimen fingerprint did not incriminate the accused and was not evidence against the accused by itself. It was the fingerprint collected from the scene of the crime, when positively matched with the specimen fingerprint, that incriminated the accused. Thus, specimens collected from the accused are only meant for comparison with other handwritings or fingerprints. Thus, the Court held that the protection under Article 20(3) would not apply to the collection of such samples, even if obtained under compulsion. The Court also held that the mere fact that the accused was present in the police custody at the time of making a statement would not mean that the statement had been given by them under compulsion. The accused would have to show something more to establish that they were ‘compelled’"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,137,". The accused would have to show something more to establish that they were ‘compelled’. Directives of the Supreme Court (1) An accused person cannot be said to have been compelled to be a witness against himself simply because he made a statement while in police custody, without anything more. In other words, the mere fact of being in police custody at the time when the statement was made would not, by itself, lead to the inference that the accused was compelled to make the statement. However, this fact, in conjunction with other circumstances disclosed in evidence in a particular case, would be a relevant consideration in an enquiry whether or not the accused person had been compelled to make the impugned statement. (2) The mere questioning of an accused person by a police officer, resulting in a voluntary statement, which may ultimately turn out to be incriminatory, is not ‘compulsion’"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,138,". (3) ‘To be a witness’ includes making an oral or written statement, production of documents, or giving materials which may be relevant at a trial to determine the guilt innocence of the accused. (4) Giving thumb impressions or impressions of foot or palm or fingers or specimen writings or showing parts of the body by way of identification are not included in the expression ‘to be a witness’. (5) ‘To be a witness’ means giving personal knowledge in respect of relevant facts by an oral or written statement, made or given in Court or at any other time. (6) ‘To be a witness’ in its ordinary grammatical sense means giving oral testimony in Court. However, the constitutional interpretation of this expression has a wider meaning, i.e. bearing testimony in or out of Court, by a person accused of an offence, whether orally or in writing"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,139,". 40 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA (7) To bring the statement in question within the prohibition of Article 20(3), the person accused must have stood in the character of an accused person at the time they made the statement. It is not enough that they should become an accused, any time after the statement has been made. Developments in the Law In India, Kathi Kalu Oghad is the most important judgment on the doctrine of protection against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. It settled the law regarding the collection of bodily samples from accused. This paved the way for other statutes and judgments to expand the extent of specimens that could be collected from the accused. For example, in Ritesh Sinha v State of Uttar Pradesh72, this principle was extended to voice samples as well, even though the police or Magistrate did not have any power to collect voice samples under the CrPC"

In 2005, the legislature amended the CrPC to insert Sections 311A, which provided the Magistrate the power to order a person to give specimen signatures or handwriting73. The amendment also empowered the police to request a medical practitioner to examine the body parts or discharges of accused, such as blood stains, semen, hair, fingernail clippings etc. by the use of scientific techniques such as DNA profiling74, for collection of evidence.

Brief Facts During the investigation, the police sought to collect the voice specimen/sample from an accused for comparison with a recorded conversation that the police had gathered in evidence.

Whether in the absence of any provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure, can a Magistrate authorize the investigating agency to record the voice specimen of the person accused of an offence? Observations of the Court On the first issue, the Court began by going back to the legal position settled by State of Bombay v Kathi Kalu Oghad76, that the fundamental right against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India prohibited a statement or testimony given by the accused that had the tendency to incriminate them. However, it did not include “materials for comparison” such as handwriting, signature, or finger impression of the accused. The Court also noted, as held in Kathi Kalu Oghad, that giving such material for comparison could mean that the accused was being ‘compelled to be a witness’ and provide evidence, but not against himself. Thus, Article 20(3) would not be violated by the compelled collection of voice specimens of the accused"

Puttaswamy v Union of India77, where it was held that the fundamental right to privacy is not absolute, and in certain circumstances, may have to bow down to a compelling public interest. On the second issue, the Court recognised that a specific provision in the CrPC for the collection of the voice specimen of an accused during the investigation was missing, although such provisions with regard to blood and DNA samples78, handwriting sample79, and medical examination of rape accused80, had been introduced in the CrPC through amendments.

Directives of the Court By exercising the constitutional authority vested in the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India81, it conferred the power on a Magistrate to order a person to give a specimen/ sample of their voice for the purpose of investigation of a crime.

This is particularly crucial since the legislature did amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to grant powers to the Magistrate for collection of blood, DNA or handwriting samples, but not for collection of voice samples. Thus, the Supreme Court had overridden the legislative intent of restricting the power of the Magistrate when it came to voice samples. Another point of criticism is the dismissal of the fundamental right to privacy in favour of the “compelling public interest”, without undertaking a detailed comparison or weighing of these two competing interests. 81 Section 142"

Conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate and confidential character. Telephone-conversation is a part of modern man’s life. It is considered so important that more and more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in their pockets. Telephone conversation is an important facet of a man’s private life. Right to privacy would certainly include telephone-conversation in the privacy of one’s home or office.” Brief Facts The Petitioner, a civil rights organisation, filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 188582"

This provision empowered the government to intercept or ‘tap’ phones for specified reasons. The petition was filed in the wake of the CBI report ‘Tapping of politicians phones’, which revealed that several intelligence, law enforcement, and investigating agencies had been authorised by the central and state governments to intercept phones. It also revealed hundreds of instances of unauthorised interceptions, interceptions beyond the authorised period, and improper maintenance of interception files and records. The Petitioner argued that this power of interception was very broad and undefined, and therefore, arbitrary. It violated the fundamental rights of persons and should be held to be unconstitutional. It also sought the introduction of safeguards to Section 5(2), to rule out arbitrariness and to prevent indiscriminate phone-tapping by governments"

Applying this right to the issue of phone interceptions, the Court held that it included the right to hold a telephonic conversation in the privacy of one’s home or office without interference. The Article 19(1)(a) right to freedom of speech and expression meant the right to express one’s convictions and opinions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, picture, or in any other manner. When a person is talking on the telephone, they are exercising their right to freedom of speech and expression. Thus, the tapping of telephone calls restricted this right, and would be unconstitutional unless it came within one of the grounds of restriction under Article 19(2)84"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,157,". Discussing the provisions of Section 5(2), the Court noted that it allowed the Central Government or State Government or any officer specially authorised in this behalf, to intercept messages (which includes calls) in the event of the occurrence of a public emergency or in the interest of public safety. Also, the government had to be satisfied that it was necessary in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, or to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence. Thus, two sets of conditions had to be satisfied before the government could allow an interception under Section 5(2). However, it held that Section 5(2) did not prescribe any procedure according to which this power to intercept had to be exercised. This made the power to intercept telephones arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,158,". This made the power to intercept telephones arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. This failed to meet the standard of ‘just, fair, and reasonable’, that every mode of restriction of fundamental rights had to meet, as held in Maneka Gandhi v Union of India85. Therefore, while the Court did not declare Section 5(2) to be unconstitutional, it laid down a set of procedural safeguards for the exercise of the power to intercept telephones under Section 5(2). Directives by the Court (1) An order for telephone-tapping in terms of Section 5(2) can only be issued by the Home Secretary, Government of India (Central Government) and Home Secretaries of the State Governments.

It held that if a network service provider receives a request or communication under Section 5(2) for interception, they should first verify its authenticity from the author if there is any doubt on its authenticity or bona fides, before allowing the interception, since any authorised interception violated the fundamental right to privacy. 86 (2011) 7 SC 69 46 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA POORAN MAL v DIRECTOR OF INSPECTION (INVESTIGATION), AIR 1974 SC 348 (A Judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India) “... neither by invoking the spirit of our Constitution nor by a strained construction of any of the fundamental rights can we spell out the exclusion of evidence obtained on an illegal search” Brief Facts Various search and seizure operations were conducted by the Income Tax authorities, at the properties of the Petitioner, a businessman.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,165,". These search and seizure operations were challenged by the Petitioner in court on several grounds including that the authorisation for the search and seizure was illegal and mala fide, and not in conformity with the powers under the Income Tax Act. It was prayed by the Petitioner that since the search and seizure itself was illegal, the evidence so seized should not be allowed to be used in any prosecution or proceedings against him. Issues for consideration Is evidence obtained in an illegal search and seizure admissible? Put differently, if an evidence has been collected illegally during an investigation, can that evidence be used in the prosecution of a person? Observations by the Court The Court noted that there was no provision in the Constitution of India that prohibited the admission of evidence obtained in an illegal search and seizure"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,166,". Even under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which governed the admissibility of evidence in India, illegality of the search did not make the evidence inadmissible. Thus, an evidence may have been collected illegally, but as long it was relevant, it was admissible. According to the Court, the spirit of the Constitution was not to exclude such evidence, contrary to what was argued by the Petitioner. Citing the Constitutional Bench judgment in MP Sharma v Satish Chandra87, the Court held that unlike the Constitution of the United States that specifically protected citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment88, there was no such provision in the Constitution of India, nor was there any justification to import any such right"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,167,". Thus, in India, as in England, the test of admissibility of an evidence lay in its relevance, and unless there was a prohibition in the Constitution or any other law against evidence gathered as a result of illegal search or seizure, it could not be shut out.89 Coming to the present case, the Court concluded that even if the search and seizure was in contravention of the powers of the authorities in the Income Tax Act, the material seized was liable to be used in the Income Tax proceedings against the person from whom it was seized. 87 AIR 1954 SC 300 88 The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 89 This is a reference to the doctrine of ‘fruits of a poisonous tree’"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,168,". 89 This is a reference to the doctrine of ‘fruits of a poisonous tree’. According to this doctrine, the evidence (fruit) from an illegal search or seizure which is a tainted source (the tree), would also be tainted and hence, inadmissible. This judgment essentially holds that the doctrine does not apply in India. 47 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS Developments in the Law Even before Pooran Mal, the Supreme Court had held in Radha Kishan v State of UP90, that a person whose premises were being searched illegally in contravention of the provisions of the CrPC could resist such illegal search on their premises. However, the judgment also held that the evidence seized or obtained during such an illegal search would not be illegal, though the courts should examine such evidence carefully before relying on it. Though not illegal or admissible, illegally obtained evidence had to be approached with caution, as advised by the Supreme Court in Dr. Pratap Singh vs"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,169,". Pratap Singh vs. Director of Enforcement, Foreign Exchange Regulation Act & Ors.91. In State of M.P. through CBI & Ors. v Paltan Mallah & Ors.92, the Supreme Court explicitly relaxed the requirement of strict adherence to the provisions of CrPC in searches and seizures. It was held that the general provisions related to search and seizure in the CrPC should be treated as guidelines and not mandatory, and in case of minor violations in collection of evidence, the discretion lay with the court whether to accept or reject the evidence. In Yashwant Sinha v. CBI93, the Pooran Mal principle of admissibility was applied to three documents published by The Hindu newspaper pertaining to the Rafale Aircraft purchase deal, including two ‘secret’ documents under the Official Secrets Act, 1923. The Court held that even if the documents had been obtained improperly by the newspaper, they could not be shut out of consideration since they passed the test of relevancy"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,170,". However, this principle of admissibility of illegally obtained evidence does not apply to seizures of drugs/contraband for prosecutions under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS Act), as held by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in State of Punjab v Baldev Singh94. This was held so, because prosecutions of persons for possession of drugs depended almost solely on recovery and seizure of drugs from them. Therefore, given the importance of this evidence of possession and seizure of drugs in proving the guilt of the accused, illegally seized drugs, by violating the provision of search and seizure under the NDPS Act95, could not be made admissible in evidence. Otherwise, convictions of persons would be the direct outcome of drugs seized by violating the provisions of search and seizure"

The Magistrate rejected the application on the ground that the accused could not be compelled to produce any document that would incriminate him, citing Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. When the issue came up before the Sessions Judge, the issue was referred to the High Court of Gujarat in a criminal reference96.

Issue for consideration In exercise of the power under Section 94(1) CrPC97, can a court summon an accused before it to produce a document or a thing in their possession? Or would such a summons or order, violate the protection against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India by compelling an accused ‘to be a witness against himself’? Observations by the Court The Supreme Court noted that the rule against self-incrimination98 was a fundamental criminal law principle in other common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the United 96 References can be sent by any court to its High Court under Section 395 CrPC, where any case pending before that court involves a question as to the validity of an Act, Ordinance or Regulation, or any provision under it, and the court thinks that the same is invalid or inoperative, but it has not been declared so by the High Court"

(2) Any person required under this section merely to produce a document or other thing shall be deemed to have complied with the requisition if he causes such document or thing to be produced instead of attending personally to produce the same.

No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.

This right acts as a protection for an accused, making illegal, all evidence gathered or collected by violating it. 50 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA States. However, this rule as applicable in India was not absolute. For instance, it did not apply to civil proceedings, or proceedings involving imposition of penalties or forfeitures. Nor did it apply to witnesses in trials, who could not be excused from answering questions that may incriminate themselves or expose them to penalties.99 The Court referred to its earlier Constitution Bench judgments in M.P. Sharma & Ors. v Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi100 and State of Bombay v Kathi Kalu Oghad & Ors.101 to reiterate that Article 20(3) protection was available to accused and witnesses. It would stand to be violated if the document sought from the accused/witness contained statements based on their personal testimony or had the tendency to incriminate them"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,177,". Such protections were part of the CrPC as well, where persons were exempted from answering questions that might expose them to a criminal charge.102 Coming to the provision in question i.e. Section 94 of the CrPC, 1898, the Supreme Court noted that Section 94 authorised a court or the police to issue a summons or written order to ‘a person’ who had in their possession, a document or a thing that was relevant to a criminal case. Under Section 96 of the CrPC, 1898, the court also had the power to issue a search warrant if that person would not produce that document or thing, or the court did not know who was in possession of that document or thing, or for a general search and inspection103. The court could also specify the particular place which had to be searched or inspected"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,178,". The court could also specify the particular place which had to be searched or inspected. According to the Supreme Court, a summon or written order under Section 94 to a person to produce a document or a thing could not be issued to an accused in a criminal case, if that document or thing tended to incriminate them. This would directly violate Article 20(3). The Court also held that the use of the word ‘person’ in Sections 94 and 96 instead of the word ‘accused’, meant that such power was only intended to be used against a person who was not an accused. Thus, an accused who possesses a document or thing that incriminates them in a criminal case, cannot be summoned by a court or the police to produce that document or thing. However, the above does not impact the power of the police to themselves conduct search to recover or seize evidence against an accused under other provisions of the CrPC104"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,179,". This is so because in such a situation, the accused would not be compelled ‘to be a witness against himself’, and Article 20(3) would not be violated. 99 Section 132 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 100 AIR 1954 SC 300 101 AIR 1961 SC 1808 102 For example, Section 161(2) CrPC states that a police officer investigating a case may examine any person who has knowledge of the facts of that case, and that person will be bound to answer all such questions truthfully, except the questions whose answers would have a tendency to expose that person to a criminal charge or penalty or forfeiture. 103 A general search warrant is for a roving search to discover documents, things, or objects related to criminal liability of persons in a case, or to discover a specific document(s), thing(s), or object(s) when its location or possessor is not known. Because it is such a wide power, it must be exercised by the court only after applying its mind and finding necessary reasons for its issuance"

Such a summons or written order would violate the constitutional protection against self-incrimination available to an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. Developments in the Law In V. S. Kuttan Pillai v Ramakrishnan & Anr.105, the issue that arose before the Supreme Court was whether a search warrant could be issued under Section 93 CrPC, 1973106 [corresponding to Section 96, CrPC, 1898], for an office which belonged to the accused to seize a document or a thing"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,181,". The Court held that if a summons could not be issued to an accused under Section 91 CrPC, 1973 [corresponding to Section 94 CrPC, 1898] because it violated Article 20(3), then by extension, no search warrant could be issued against the accused under Section 93. However, a general search or inspection warrant could be issued by a court, and its execution in the premises of the accused to search and seizure documents, even those that could incriminate the accused, would not be illegal. But even then, the accused could not be compelled to incriminate themselves in these search and seizure proceedings, for instance by forcing the accused to participate in them, because that would violate Article 20(3). They could remain a passive spectator to the search proceedings. 105 AIR 1980 SC 185 106 Section 93. When search warrant may be issued"

During the investigation, the police interrogated her. During the interrogation, the police gave her a written list of questions and sought her oral responses. However, she refused to answer them. This led to the police invoking a charge under Section 179 of the Indian Penal Code107 for refusing to answer the questions. She challenged the invocation of this charge before the High Court and then the Supreme Court.

On the other side was the public-policy need to empower police to investigate crimes by interrogating and obtaining answers from an accused. Under Section 161(2) CrPC, a right of silence was available to a witnesses being questioned by the police during an investigation, if the answer to a particular question had the tendency to expose them to a criminal charge109. So the questions before the Court were: Did the Petitioner, who was an accused not a witness, have a right to silence during an interrogation, and could an accused refuse to answer questions either on the basis of the Article 20(3) protection or Section 161(2) CrPC? If so, what was the extent of that right? Thus, the Supreme Court framed the following issues of present relevance: 1"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,186,". Is a person ‘suspected’ of a crime entitled to the right to silence which is available to a person ‘accused’ of a crime? Or is it enough that the person is only a ‘potential’ accused? 107 Section 179. Refusing to answer public servant authorised to question.—Whoever, being legally bound to state the truth on any subject to any public servant, refuses to answer any question demanded of him touching that subject by such public servant in the exercise of the legal powers of such public servant, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both. 108 Article 20(3). No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. This fundamental right essentially means that a person cannot be compelled or forced to become a witness against themselves in a criminal case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,187,". Thus, any action of the police, where the evidence has been collected in violation of this fundamental right, would be unconstitutional and illegal. This right acts as a protection for an accused, making illegal, all evidence gathered or collected by violating it. 109 Section 161. Examination of witnesses by police. (1) Any police officer making an investigation under this Chapter, or any police officer not below such rank as the State Government may, by general or special order, prescribe in this behalf, acting on the requisition of such officer, may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case. (2) Such person shall be bound to answer truly all questions relating to such case put to him by such officer, other than questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture.

Does the protection against self-incrimination operate only for the particular accusation for which the person is being questioned, or does it also extend to other pending or potential accusations outside that specific investigation? That is to say, can an accused person, who is being questioned by a police officer in a certain case, refuse to answer questions that are incriminating only for that case, or even for any other case as well? 3. Is the right to silence available to a person only in Court or is it also available during interrogation during the police investigation? 4"

What is the ambit of the cryptic expression ‘compelled to be a witness against himself’ occurring in Article 20(3) of the Constitution? Does ‘compulsion’ mean physical pressure or unlawful duress or does it also cover the cryptic compulsions or psychic coercion, given a tense situation or officer in authority interrogating an accused person, armed with power to insist on an answer? 5. Does being ‘a witness against himself’ include testimonial tendency to incriminate or also any probability of guilt flowing from the answer? 6. What are the parameters of Section 161(2) CrPC? Does the tendency to expose a person to a criminal charge also include answers which have an inculpatory impact in other criminal cases actually or about to be investigated or tried? 7. Does ‘any person’ in Section 161 CrPC include an accused person or only a witness? 8"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,190,". Does ‘any person’ in Section 161 CrPC include an accused person or only a witness? 8. When does an answer self-incriminate or tend to expose one to a charge? What distinguishes permissible and impermissible interrogations and answers? Is the setting of the interrogation relevant or not? 9. Does mens rea110 form a necessary component of Section 179 IPC, and, if so, what is its precise nature? Can a mere apprehension that any answer has a guilty potential form a defence against a charge of Section 179, IPC? 10. Where do we demarcate the boundaries of benefit of doubt in the setting of Section 161(2) CrPC and Section 179 IPC? Observations by the Court The Supreme Court undertook a deep assessment of the constituent words of Article 20(3) in order to extract its meaning and applicability and the issues for consideration in this case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,191,". The Court noted that Article 20(3) existed in the form of a general fundamental right protection and was available to every accused person in India, but its wording was not very specific about which situations it applied to. For instance, unlike Section 161(2) CrPC, which specifically applied during the questioning of a witness in an investigation, Article 20(3) did not by itself specify what stage of a case it applied to - investigations, inquiries or trials. Therefore, the Court interpreted the words “to be a witness against himself” to carry a wide meaning, and concluded that the Article 20(3) protection was available to an accused person at any stage of a case. However, in other respects, the Court read the Article 20(3) protection narrowly. For instance, it held that such protection was only available 110 Mens rea refers to the intention to commit a crime"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,192,". 54 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA against statements made by the accused that were confessional or had a clear tendency to self- incriminate. Thus, the Article 20(3) protection was not a blanket protection against giving any statement to the police. Similarly after analysing the words “accused of any offence”, the Court held that this meant that the accusation could be in relation to the case the person was being questioned in, or any other offence pending or imminent. However, citing Kathi Kalu Oghad v State of Bombay111, it held that only a person who was an accused at the time of their interrogation would have the protection of Article 20(3). But if they gave a statement before they became an accused in the case, the Article 20(3) protection would not be available against that statement"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,193,". The words “compelled to be a witness” and the compulsion prohibited by Article 20(3) included not just physical threats or violence, but also psychic torture, atmospheric pressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative, overbearing or intimidatory methods. The use of these methods to obtain a testimony from the accused would be considered compulsion and thus, prohibited by Article 20(3). But it excluded the threat of legal penalty for violation upon refusal to answer, although frequent threats of prosecution for not answering the question may be considered as undue pressure, violating Article 20(3). Coming to the crucial issue of how such a right is to be realised within the confines of a police station, the Court drew inspiration from the right to access to a lawyer during interrogations mandated by the United States Supreme Court in Miranda v Arizona112"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,194,". The Court held that the access to a lawyer is essential to a person availing their Article 20(3) rights during interrogation and the lawyer of the person should be allowed to be present at the time of their examination. This was not only to prevent right violations by the answering of questions that run afoul the Article 20(3) protection, but also by intercepting any intimidation or any other tactic by the police to obtain incriminating statements. However, it was clarified that the lawyer could not supply answers to the person or otherwise interfere with the questioning. It went a step further, and directed that the police must warn the accused about their Article 20(3) rights prior to the interrogation itself"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,195,". Another crucial discussion in the judgment was on another question: What was the purpose behind interrogating an accused? Was it to obtain a confession through whatever means necessary, or was it a more meaningful search for facts and the truth? And what means were justified in this process? In answering these questions, the Court underlined the link between confessions and the torture that is used to obtain them. The Court unequivocally lay on the side of investigators deploying skillful and psychological interrogations over physical ones that, to put it in the Court’s own words, rely on giving “the fist a rest and the wit restlessness”. Coming down strongly on the use of torture during interrogations, it held that the first obligation of the criminal justice system was to secure justice by seeking and substantiating truth through proof"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,196,". In this process, the means must be as good as the ends and the dignity and freedom of the individual could not be sacrificed by resorting to improper means, however worthy the ends. Thus, the Court advised a system where a person without a lawyer would be taken to a non-partisan official such as a Doctor or a Magistrate after their interrogation, so as to inform them about possible Article 20(3) violations i.e. taking of compelled statements of the accused. This, the Court believed, would make the process of enforcing Article 20(3) rights more practical and realistic. In the end, the Court directed the Petitioner to answer all non-incriminatory questions put to her by the police, and directed that in case she sought the protection of Article 20(3) from answering any question, she must indicate in which case or offence the answer of such question may incriminate 111 AIR 1961 SC 1808 112 384 U.S. 436 (1966) 55 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS her"

It also directed that the Investigating Officer had the freedom to prosecute her under Section 179 IPC for any wrongful refusal to answer a question under the guise of the Article 20(3) protection. Developments in the Law Despite being a landmark judgment on the right of silence under Article 20(3) and the right to access a lawyer during interrogations, Nandini Satpathy’s applicability has been restricted by subsequent judgments on the latter issue. In Poolpandi v Superintendent, Central Excise113, the Supreme Court limited the applicability of the direction to access a lawyer during interrogation to only apply to “regular criminal cases” initiated by the “police”. According to Poolpandi, this did not apply to investigations, inquiries, and prosecutions under the Customs Act, since customs officials were legally not “police”114"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,198,". In Senior Intelligence Officer v Jugal Kishore Samra115, the Supreme Court applied the Poolpandi rule of excluding Customs Act cases to cases under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act as well. However, given the precarious health of the Petitioner in that case, it made an exception and allowed the presence of a lawyer at some distance or behind a glass partition, without the right to speak to the lawyer during the interrogation. 113 AIR 1992 SC 1795 114 Illias v Collector of Customs, Madras, AIR 1970 SC 1065. However, the issue whether an official under the NDPS Act is a police official or not has been referred to a larger bench of the Supreme Court for consideration in Tofan Singh v State of Tamil Nadu, Criminal Appeal No. 152/2013. 115 (2011) 12 SCC 362 56 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA SELVI & ORS. v STATE OF KARNATAKA & ANR"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,199,". v STATE OF KARNATAKA & ANR., AIR 2010 SC 1974 (A Judgment of the Full Bench of the Supreme Court of India) An accused cannot be compelled to undergo a narco analysis test, polygraphic examination, or a Brain Electrical Activation Profile test. Brief Facts During the investigation of a criminal case, the police sought to administer tests like narco analysis test116, polygraph examination117, Brain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) etc. upon the Petitioner who was an accused in the case. According to the police, these were investigative tools that could be administered on the accused to help with the investigation. But the Petitioner/accused refused to voluntarily undergo these tests, and claimed that the involuntary administering of these tests would violate the Article 20(3) protection from self-incrimination118"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,200,". The Karnataka High Court ruled that since polygraph examination and BEAP test119 recorded physiological, not verbal, responses of the accused/test subject, they were not ‘testimonial compulsion’, and thus did not violate Article 20(3). Regarding the answers given during a narco analysis, the High Court held that they did not violate Article 20(3) because at the time of giving the answers by the accused/test subject, it was not known whether those answers were incriminating or not. Issues for consideration 1. Whether the involuntary administration of certain scientific technique tests like narco analysis, polygraph examination, and the BEAP test violate the ‘right against self-incrimination’ in Article 20(3) of the Constitution? 2"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,201,". Whether the investigative use of these techniques created a likelihood of incrimination for the test subject? 116 In a narco analysis test (commonly referred to as the truth serum test), the test subject is given an intravenous drug by medical professionals (sodium pentathol) which causes them to enter a hypnotic trance and become less inhibited. This makes them more likely to divulge information in responses to the questions asked by the investigators. The premise is that during the hypnotic stage induced by the drug, the subject is unable to suppress the memories associated with relevant facts. Sodium Pentathol is also the drug given to patients as general anesthesia in surgical procedures"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,202,". Sodium Pentathol is also the drug given to patients as general anesthesia in surgical procedures. 117 In a polygraph examination (commonly referred to as a lie-detector test) several instruments such as cardiographs, pneumographs, cardio-cuffs and sensitive electrodes, are attached to the subject for measuring and recording the physiological responses like respiration, blood pressure, blood flow, pulse and galvanic skin resistance. Then, the subject is questioned by the examiner, and this test captures the physiological responses of the subject while answering those questions. It is said that in case the subject is lying, they will produce a different physiological response than when they are answering honestly. This, it is said, separates the false responses from the truthful ones. 118 Article 20(3). No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,203,". No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. This fundamental right essentially means that a person cannot be compelled or forced to become a witness against themselves in a criminal case. Thus, any action of the police, where the evidence has been collected in violation of this fundamental right, would be unconstitutional and illegal. This right acts as a protection for an accused, making illegal, all evidence gathered or collected by violating it. 119 It is a process of detecting whether an individual is familiar with certain information by way of measuring activity in the brain that is triggered by exposure to selected stimuli. It is conducted by attaching electrodes to the scalp of the test subject and the subject is then exposed to auditory or visual stimuli (words, sounds, pictures, videos) that are relevant to the facts being investigated alongside other irrelevant words and pictures"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,204,". The electrodes measure the emission of the wave components by the subject upon exposure to the stimuli. The underlying theory is that in the case of guilty suspects, the exposure to the material probes will lead to the emission of P300 wave components which will be duly recorded by instruments. By examining the records of these wave components, the examiner can make inferences about the subject’s familiarity with the information related to the crime. 57 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS 3. Whether the results derived from these techniques amounted to ‘testimonial compulsion’ thereby attracting the bar of Article 20(3)? 4"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,205,". Whether the involuntary administration of these techniques is a reasonable restriction on ‘personal liberty’ as understood in the context of Article 21 of the Constitution? Observations by the Court After discussing the techniques of these tests and the limited reliability of their results, the Court observed that Article 20(3) prohibited compulsion on the accused to give statements that would be incriminating. By barring such compelled statements, Article 20(3) operated as a vital safeguard in favour of the liberties of the accused. Without it, investigators would have an incentive to compel the accused to give incriminating statements, encouraging the use of torture and other ‘third- degree methods’ by the police to obtain them. In this way, Article 20(3) also ensured the right to personal liberty under Article 21"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,206,". In this way, Article 20(3) also ensured the right to personal liberty under Article 21. The Supreme Court disagreed with the High Court’s conclusion, and held that if these tests/ techniques were administered involuntarily/compulsorily to the accused, the statement or information obtained from them would be based on coercion, threat, or inducement. This would clearly violate the Article 20(3) protection against compelled self-incrimination and would be inadmissible as evidence. Therefore, the accused had a right to silence against questions whose answers would be incriminating, and any force, threat or coercion used to compel the accused to answer them would violate Article 20(3). The Court noted that a compelled ‘testimony’ was prohibited by Article 20(3), and since narco analysis involved the accused actually speaking, such testimony would be prohibited by Article 20(3)"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,207,". However, the situation was different for polygraph examination and the BEAP test since they were not based on any verbal testimony by the accused; but on the inferences drawn from their physiological responses to questions or probes. The Court held that that ‘testimonial compulsion’ prohibited by Article 20(3) was not limited to verbal responses but also extended to non-verbal responses. The inferences drawn in polygraph or BEAP were based on the physiological responses of the accused while answering questions. Thus, since the answers were themselves based on the personal knowledge of the accused, so too were the physiological responses, and by extension, the results/inferences. Therefore, the results of these test were based on the personal knowledge of the accused. This amounts to more than the mere the collection of physical characteristics or information for identification or corroboration120, and so, they violated Article 20(3)"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,208,". Put differently, the physiological responses collected from an accused during polygraph or BEAP tests were not the same as collecting their fingerprint or handwriting samples, since the former involved the personal knowledge of the accused, whereas the latter did not. On the fourth issue, the Court held that the involuntary or compelled administration of any of these tests curtailed ‘personal liberty’, since the forcible interference with the mental processes of the subject amounted to an invasion of their right to privacy, and also constituted ‘cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment’ which is prohibited under Article 21121. The results gathered from these techniques also came into conflict with the right to a fair trial. Invocation of a compelling public interest cannot justify the dilution of constitutional rights such as the right against self-incrimination"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,209,". 120 In State of Bombay v Kathi Kalu Oghad, the Supreme Court had held that if the compelled incriminating statement of the accused was based on their personal knowledge of the facts, it would be prohibited by Article 20(3). But the collection of physical characteristics for identification did not violate Article 20(3). 121 Francis Coralie Mullin v The Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, AIR 1981 SC 746 58 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA However, the Court clarified that the protection of Article 20(3) would only be available against compelled administration of these tests. If the accused willingly consents to undergo any of these tests, the protection would not be available. Nor would the protection be available if the compelled administration was in the course of civil proceedings"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,210,". Even when the tests are administered by consent of the accused, the test results themselves did not constitute evidence, but only the information or material subsequently discovered with the help of the test results could be admissible in evidence under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. 59 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS DISTRICT REGISTRAR & COLLECTOR, HYDERABAD & ANR.

It granted virtually limitless powers of search and seizure to any person authorised by the District Collector, in any private property, without any requirement of recording the reasons necessitating the search. The dispute arose when this power was sought to be exercised for searches and seizures in banks to seize records of their account holders. Upon being challenged by the banks, the High Court struck down the amendment as it violated the right to equal treatment under the law under Article 14 of the Constitution. Thus, the matter reached the Supreme Court"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,212,". Thus, the matter reached the Supreme Court. Issues for consideration Whether such unrestricted power to seize financial documents of customers from their banks was legal and constitutional? Observations by the Court The Court held that under Article 21, the right to privacy had been recognised under the Constitution and upheld by the Supreme Court in earlier judgments, Kharak Singh v State of UP123, Govind v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.124 and R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu125. The right to privacy had been recognised as ‘the right to be left alone’, though it was not an absolute right. For instance, it could not be claimed over public records. It could also be superseded by a compelling public interest such as prevention and investigation of a crime"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,213,". The amended Section 73 applicable in Andhra Pradesh allowed any person authorised by the District Collector to get access to documents in private custody or the custody of a public officer, whether those documents were evidence or not. Any such person could exercise this power without them or the District Collector recording any reasons for why such a search was necessary. Thus, the power under this provision was very broad, unregulated, and unjustified. 122 Section 73"

It did not matter whether the documents related to those accounts or transactions were in their own premises, or in the premises of the bank. The right to privacy of an account holder over their banking documents existed not just in their own home, but also in the documents kept at the bank. Thus, the right to privacy flowed from the ‘person’ and not the place’. The searches challenged by the banks in the present case subjected them to legally unsustainable encroachments that were without any reasonable or probable basis"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,216,". Unless the District Collector had a probable or reasonable cause, or basis or material to reach an opinion that the documents in possession of the bank tended to prove or lead to the discovery of any fraud related to stamp duty, such search or seizure would not be valid. Similarly, the Court held that the power given to the District Collector under the amendment to authorise any person to conduct search and seizure was also excessive and unconstitutional. The State had to clearly designate the officers who could conduct search and seizure, or specify a minimum criteria of seniority for such an officer. The amendment thus, did not pass the test of ‘fair, just and reasonable’ as devised in Maneka Gandhi v Union of India126. In conclusion, the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of the High Court and declared the amendments to be unconstitutional.

Although not dealing strictly with the police or its powers under the CrPC, this judgment lays down the general constitutional directive: the procedure for searches and seizures under the law cannot be unfair, unreasonable, or arbitrary.

Three persons died and many other persons sustained injuries, including police officials. Two FIRs were registered for the incidents, the first on the complaint of a Sub- Inspector of Gujarat Police, and the second on the complaint of the Appellant, a member of the Koli Patel community. After completion of the investigations, charge sheets were filed by the police in both cases against the same accused. Persons belonging to the Bharwad community alleged that the investigation had favoured the Koli Patel community and had been biased against their community. It was alleged that the police had not recorded any statements of witnesses of the Bharwad community who had been injured or whose houses had been burnt down"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,219,". Without those statements, the charge sheet filed by the police against the accused belonging to the Koli Patel community was weak and ineffective, and would ultimately result in their acquittal. Also, it was alleged that the police had shielded these accused from arrest by claiming that they were absconding and could not be found, whereas actually they had been seen attending court with the police itself. The Gujarat High Court agreed with the bias allegations, and transferred the investigation to the State CB-CID Crime Branch. It quashed the second FIR and clubbed it with the first one, and directed that a fresh investigation be conducted in the clubbed case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,220,". Issues for consideration Although the main issue in this case related to the registration of two FIRs regarding the same set of incidents, the other issue, presently of relevance, was: What is the right to a free and fair investigation of an accused under Article 21 of the Constitution of India? What was the duty of the court if an investigation had been unfair, biased, and mala fide? Observations by the Court It is the duty of the police to carry out an investigation that is fair and without any ulterior motives. The conduct of the police had to be impartial, without any suspicion towards its genuineness, and should exclude any fabrication of evidence. A fair investigation was the backbone of the Rule of Law"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,221,". A fair investigation was the backbone of the Rule of Law. Relying on judicial precedents127, the Supreme Court held that the role of the investigator of a criminal case was not to strengthen the prosecution’s case on the basis of any evidence merely to secure a conviction, but to unearth and bring out “the real and unvarnished truth” before the court. 127 RP Kapur v State of Punjab, AIR 1960 SC 866, Jamuna Chaudhary v State of Bihar, AIR 1974 SC 1822 and Mahmood v State of UP, AIR 1976 SC 69. 62 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA The right to a fair investigation was part of the fundamental rights of accused persons under Articles 20128 and 21129 of the Constitution of India. Article 21 prohibited the restriction/deprivation of the personal liberty of any person by a procedure not established by law. An unfair, unjust or malicious investigation, could not possibly be considered to be a ‘procedure established by law’ and thus, would be arbitrary deprivation of personal liberty"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,222,". The investigation of a criminal case was a statutory power that under the CrPC, was exclusively within the domain of the executive and the police. The judiciary should normally not interfere with it. However, if the police had investigated in a mala fide manner, or abused its powers, the courts had a duty to interfere if necessary, and ensure a fair and proper investigation. If the court found an investigation to be biased, and not proper or objective, to help a particular party in a case, the court could direct further investigation. However, in exceptional/special/ extraordinary cases, to prevent the miscarriage of justice130, the court had the power to order a fresh investigation131. Applying these principles to the present case, the Supreme Court held that the investigation had been totally one-sided, biased, and mala fide. One community had clearly been favoured by the police, and the other had faced unwarranted harassment"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,223,". If the investigation had been unfair, the charge sheet being its outcome, was also invalid. The charge sheet was unreliable, to reveal the truth about the incidents that had taken place. Thus, in conclusion, the Supreme Court upheld the transfer of investigation to the independent agency, and quashed the charge sheets filed by the police. Directives of the Court If the investigation in a criminal case was biased, unfair, or mala fide, the High Court and the Supreme Court can interfere with the investigation and take steps or pass orders to ensure a proper investigation. In exercise of this power, it can even transfer the investigation to another investigating agency. Developments in the Law A fair and unbiased investigation is not just a right of an accused - a complainant or a victim of a crime equally has a right to a fair investigation under Article 21, as held by the Supreme Court in Nirmal Singh Kahlon v State of Punjab132"

It refers to the process of conducting an investigation of the entire case afresh. This means a re-examination or re-assessment of the entire case from the police from the start. This is different from ‘further investigation’, which refers to a limited process of investigating specific aspects of the case that the police had not investigated properly earlier or not investigated at all. 132 AIR 2009 SC 984 133 AIR 2000 SC 3275 63 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS Supreme Court ruled that all police investigations had to be funded by the State, and prohibited the police from taking any financial assistance from private parties (such as the complainant or the victim) to meet the expenses of the investigation"

Accepting such financial assistance would compromise the fairness of the investigation, which was a fundamental right. It would also unfairly disadvantage poor persons in comparison to rich persons who could use their resources to influence the investigation in their favour. Another aspect of neutrality that has been emphasised by the Court in Mohan Lal v State of Punjab134 is that a police official who was the informant of an FIR, could not be the investigator of that FIR. This was to exclude any possibility of bias or a predetermined conclusion in the investigation of the case. 134 AIR 2018 SC 3853 64 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA F.

Issues for consideration How can the Court, in exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, rectify the injustice suffered by the Petitioner? Observations by the Court Under the ordinary process of the law in India, a monetary claim for enforcement of rights or obligations had to be made before a civil or criminal court. For the enforcement of Fundamental Rights, monetary compensation to the victim did not strictly form part of the jurisprudence in India. Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India135, the Supreme Court has the power to issue writs such as habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari for the enforcement of any Fundamental Right under Part III of the Constitution. Thus"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,229,". Thus. the Court could exercise the Article 32 power to remedy or prevent the violation of Article 21 right to life and liberty, and that could also mean ordering monetary compensation to persons whose rights had been violated by the State and its functionaries. Thus, as a remedial measure, the Court could make the State liable to repair the damage done by its officers to the rights of the Petitioner. Also, this monetary compensation did not preclude the Petitioner or any other victim from seeking damages from the State and its officials in civil proceedings. Developments in the Law Over the years, the Courts have awarded compensation for varying violations of Fundamental Rights, especially the Article 21 right to life and liberty. For instance, compensation in the form of exemplary costs on the state for illegal arrest and imprisonment of the Petitioner with malicious intent was awarded in Bhim Singh v State of J&K & Ors"

It noted that under its Article 32(1) power to enforce fundamental rights, it was free to devise any appropriate procedure for the enforcement of such right. It also clarified that this power was not just to prevent the violation of rights, but also provide relief to victims against a breach or violation that had already been committed, which could take the form of compensation in certain cases. However, the Court also held that this power should only be exercised in “appropriate cases”, where the violation of the fundamental right was gross, patent or glaring, or it was inflicted on a large scale, or where it would be unduly harsh or oppressive to require an economically or socially disadvantaged victim to seek remedy under civil law"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,232,". Thus, enforcement of fundamental rights by award of compensation under Article 32 was an exceptional remedy, and could not be done in ordinary cases as a substitute to a remedy under private law through civil proceedings. The celebrated judgment of DK Basu v State of West Bengal138 recognised the need to make the State vicariously liable for an established infringement of the fundamental right to life of a citizen by the public servants employed by it by award of monetary compensation139. This was not only an effective, but sometimes the only suitable remedy for the redressal of established deprivation of fundamental rights. In Dr. Rini Johar & Anr. v State of MP & Ors.140, the Petitioners suffered the deprivation of their fundamental rights in the form of arrest in complete violation of the procedures in the CrPC and the judgment of DK Basu v State of West Bengal141"

His body bore several injury marks and it was alleged that his death was caused by custodial violence inflicted on him when he was in the custody of the police.

The Petitioner wrote a letter to the Supreme Court which was converted into a writ petition. In the letter she demanded compensation for the violation of the Article 21 fundamental right to life of her son. Issues for consideration The Court considered two issues: 1. Whether the death of Suman Behera was a case of a custodial death? 2. If yes, what liability did the state and police officials have to compensate the Petitioner for the death of her son? Observations by the Court The post mortem report recorded a long list of injuries on the body of the deceased, and concluded that all the injuries could have been caused by lathi blows, but not by being run over by a train. Additionally, the police failed to present any evidence that they had searched for him after his alleged escape. There was considerable delay in their arrival to the train tracks where his body was discovered. Thus, on the first issue, the Court ruled that his death was custodial in nature"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,237,". Thus, on the first issue, the Court ruled that his death was custodial in nature. Coming to the second issue, the Court held that the State did have a public law liability to compensate victims in cases of violation of their Fundamental Rights by the State or its functionaries. It cited several judgments including Rudul Shah v State of Bihar144, and Section 9(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, to assert the principle that a claim for compensation payable by the State could be made under public law based on strict liability of the State to compensate victims of contravention of Fundamental Rights, and the courts could award monetary compensation for such contraventions. Articles 32 and 226 were constitutional remedies available to victims to approach the Supreme Court or High Court, and the courts could award compensation to victims. This was over and above the private law remedy for damages resulting from the deprivation of fundamental rights145"

The Court also held that while the State could claim protection under the concept of sovereign immunity146 against a private law remedy, for a public law constitutional remedy like Article 32 or 226 of the Constitution, this protection was not available to the State. Finally, the Court directed the State to pay a compensation of Rs. 1,50,000 to the Petitioner, calculated based on the age and monthly income of the deceased"

Developments in the Law In State of Maharashtra v Christian Community Welfare Council of India147, the Court held that in cases of custodial death, the culpable police officials can personally also be held liable to compensate the family of the deceased, if the death of the person was not caused in the performance of official duty or due to abuse of force. However, in Sube Singh v State of Haryana148, the Supreme Court cautioned against award of compensation in cases where death of a person has resulted while in custody, but there is no evidence of torture supported by medical report or marks, scars or disability, or the allegations are exaggerated. In such cases, the traditional civil remedy of civil or criminal action would be the most appropriate remedy. 146 It is the immunity that a state has from being sued in court by its own citizens"

Thus, under the federal structure and principle of separation of powers, both part of the Indian Constitution, the investigation of this case could only be conducted by the state police.

Observations by the Court The Supreme Court discussed the federal system in India’s Constitution, the distribution of legislative powers between the centre and states, and the power of judicial review of constitutional courts such as the Supreme Court and the High Court. It also discussed several landmark cases, which had established the prevailing constitutional jurisprudence on these issues. The Court partly agreed with the argument of the State of West Bengal, that by transferring the investigation from the state police to the CBI, the High Court had transgressed the doctrine of separation of powers and the distribution of legislative powers. However, it reasoned that both the High Court and the Supreme Court of India, being constitutional courts, had a crucial duty to exercise their power of judicial review of executive action under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution, to do justice in cases where Fundamental Rights had been violated"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,247,". This overarching power of judicial review was so integral to India’s Constitution that it formed part of its basic structure, and could not be removed even by a constitutional amendment151. Thus, the power of judicial review to protect Fundamental Rights and do justice in case of their violation, superseded even the doctrine of separation of powers. Thus, the Court concluded that the issue of transfer of investigation from the State police to the CBI in this case should not be viewed as an issue of violation of separation of powers of the Centre and State. Instead, it should be seen as an issue of enforcement of Fundamental Rights of victims, which the Court could do under its power of judicial review to ensure justice"

The Petitioner sought quashing of this FIR by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, and a restraint on the police to investigate the case. After discussing the allegations against the Petitioner, and the law on the subject of quashing of FIRs, the High Court held that the allegations against the Petitioner did not constitute any cognizable offence. Thus, there was no basis for the police to have registered the FIR and conduct any investigation, and so it quashed the FIR. This was challenged by the State before the Supreme Court.

This provision mandates registration of any information that discloses the commission of a cognizable offence155.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,256,". A Magistrate could not interfere with the investigation. But if the investigatory powers were improperly or illegally being exercised by the police, affecting the personal liberty or property of a citizen, then the High Court could exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, and restrain the police from misusing their powers. Thus, the power to investigate was not immune from judicial scrutiny. Coming to other major issue of quashing of FIR, the Court noted that a High Court had the power to do under Article 226(1)160 of the Constitution or Section 482 of the CrPC161. But the question was under what circumstances could this power be exercised? After discussing multiple judicial precedents on this issue, the Court extracted the following categories of cases where the FIR could be quashed by the Court either to prevent the abuse of the legal process or to ensure justice, although it was not a complete or exhaustive list: 1"

The Court could not conduct an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness of the allegations, and should not use this power arbitrarily. Thus, applying these principles to the facts of the FIR against the Petitioner, the Court held that since the complaint against the Petitioner disclosed the commission of cognizable offence, the FIR had been correctly registered. The facts of the case did not fall within any of the categories laid down by the Court. But since no investigation had been conducted due to the stay of investigation by the High Court, it was premature for the Court to comment on whether the complaint was true or false. That could only be determined after an investigation had been conducted by a competent official. Therefore, it gave time to the State Government to direct an investigation into the case.

ABHINANDAN JHA & ORS. v DINESH MISHRA, AIR 1968 SC 117 76 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA (A Judgment of the Division Bench of the Supreme Court of India) “…the investigation, under the Code, takes in several aspects, and stages, ending ultimately with the formation of an opinion by the police as to whether, on the material covered and collected, a case is made out to place the accused before the Magistrate for trial, and the submission of either a charge-sheet, or a final report is dependent on the nature of the opinion, so formed. The formation of the said opinion, by the police, as pointed out earlier, is the final step in the investigation, and that final step is to be taken only by the police and by no other authority.” Brief Facts In two unconnected cases, similar points of controversy arose. In both cases, after completing the investigation the police filed a ‘final report’162 before the Magistrate to close the cases"

The reason was the same in both: the first information provided by the Complainant was found false or incorrect. In both cases, the Complainant filed a ‘protest petition’163 opposing the final report and the closure of the case. After hearing arguments, the separate Magistrates in the two cases directed that instead of closing the case, the police to file a ‘charge sheet’ against the accused. The accused challenged these orders before the Sessions Court and the High Court, without any success, and finally approached the Supreme Court"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,266,". Issues for consideration When, after the conclusion of investigation in a criminal case, the police intend to close the case by filing a final report under Section 173(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, can the Magistrate direct the police to file a charge-sheet against the accused? Thus, the Court was dealing with the issue of whether a Magistrate can direct the final outcome or conclusion of a criminal investigation and order the police to file a charge sheet against the accused? Or alternatively, can the Magistrate order the filing of a final report for closure of the case against the accused? The Supreme Court noted that there was a conflict of opinion between various High Courts on this point, and sought to resolve it. Observations by the Court The scope of powers of the police with regard to the investigation of a case was very wide, contained in Chapter XII of the CrPC, Sections 154 to 173"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,267,". Under the scheme of the CrPC, the manner and method of conducting the investigation had been left entirely to the police, and only the police had the power to form the opinion as to whether the accused should be chargesheeted or not. The Magistrate had no observable powers to interfere with the investigation or order its outcome in a particular way. However, this did not imply that the Magistrate was bound to accept the police’s opinion. Under Section 190 of CrPC, the Magistrate did have the power to ‘judicially’ deal with the report filed by the police upon the conclusion of the investigation, and could form its own opinion as to whether 162 After concluding the investigation of an FIR, the police has to file a ‘Report’ before the Magistrate under Section 173(2) of the CrPC. The police can either file a ‘Charge Sheet’ or ‘Challan’ against the accused"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,268,". The police can either file a ‘Charge Sheet’ or ‘Challan’ against the accused. However, if the police find that there is insufficient evidence or the accused has not been identified, the police can file a ‘Final Report’, also referred to as ‘Closure Report’, ‘Cancellation Report’, or ‘Untrace Report’. However, none of these terms are mentioned in the CrPC. 163 When the police file a Final Report and seek closure of the case, the complainant has the right to file a ‘Protest Petition’ before the Magistrate to oppose the closure of the case. This has evolved as a procedural practice, though there is no such right in the CrPC. See Bhagwant Singh v. Commissioner of Police, AIR 1985 SC 1285. 77 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS there was sufficient evidence to proceed with the case or not, and accordingly take cognizance of the offence164"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,269,". Therefore, even if it was the opinion of the Investigating Officer that there was a case to proceed against the accused, and a charge-sheet was filed, it was open to the Magistrate to take a different view - that no offence was made out against the accused, or that the case lacked sufficient material to prosecute the accused. Of course, if the Magistrate was in agreement with the opinion of the Investigating Officer, they could take cognizance of the offence and proceed with the case against the accused. Coming to the issue under consideration, i.e. a situation where the police opine that no case is made out against the accused, and file a ‘final report’, but the Magistrate is in disagreement. The Court observed that the Magistrate is legally empowered under Section 156(3) of the CrPC165, to reject the final report filed by the police, and instead direct the police to conduct further investigation in the case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,270,". If ultimately after further investigation, the police again file a final report, the Magistrate can still disagree with the opinion of the police and hold the view that an offence is made out, take cognizance of the offence and proceed to summon the accused. Thus, the Court concluded, that if the police files a final report in a given case, and the Magistrate disagrees with the police, then s/he cannot direct the police to file a charge-sheet. However, the Magistrate is not bound to accept the final report filed by the police and can take recourse to the above-stated options. Thus, the power of the police to investigate, and the power of the Magistrate to close or proceed with the case, were separate and independent of each other. Directives of the Supreme Court (1) The police have the sole domain over the manner of investigation of a criminal case. After completing the investigation, it is the sole decision of the police to file a charge sheet or final report in the case"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,271,". The Magistrate cannot interfere with either of these powers of the police. (2) If after investigation, the police/Investigating Officer forms the opinion that a case is made out against the accused, and files a charge-sheet, the Magistrate can accept the charge-sheet, take cognizance of the offence, and summon the accused. (3) If the Magistrate disagrees with the opinion of the police/Investigating Officer, and is of the view that no case is made out, then s/he can decline to take cognizance and close the case"

This power of the Magistrate is contained under Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. For more clarification, see R.R. Chari v.

Developments in the Law In Bhagwant Singh v Commissioner of Police166, the Supreme Court safeguarded the right of the informant/complainant/victim to be heard at this stage of the case. It held that the closure/ dropping of a criminal case prejudicially affects the right of the complainant/victim of the FIR. Thus the principles of natural justice required that prior to dropping/closing the case, the Magistrate must issue notice to the informant and give the informant an opportunity to oppose the closure of the case. Even if a person is not the informant, but is a victim or relative of the victim in a case, they do have the right to appear before the Magistrate at the time of consideration of the final report and make submissions with regard to the case, though the Magistrate is not obligated to issue notice to them.

Brief Facts In June 2011, an organisation named Bharat Swabhiman Trust obtained permissions from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Delhi Police to hold a yoga training camp for about five thousand people at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. However, instead of a yoga training camp, an anti- government agitation on the issue of corruption and illegal black money stashed abroad was organised. And on the date of the event, the crowd swelled to over fifty thousand people. The permission to hold the camp was withdrawn by the government and late at night, an order under Section 144 of the CrPC168 was passed by the police, prohibiting the agitation at the site. Past-midnight, police and para-military battalions entered Ramlila Maidan to detain the protestors who were asleep by then, leading to violence, such as throwing of bricks, lathi charge, and firing of tear gas shells by the police, in which many persons got injured"

All the protestors were driven out and Baba Ramdev, who was heading the agitation, was arrested. The Supreme Court took suo-moto notice of the incident.

Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,282,". 81 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS Observations by the Court The right to public protest was recognised under Articles 19(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of India169 i.e., the fundamental rights to free speech and expression, and to assemble peacefully without arms. However, these rights were not absolute. Articles 19(2) and 19(3)170 empowered the State to impose “reasonable restrictions” on the exercise of these rights, for one of the reasons provided. The State did not have the power to take away the right to protest by prohibiting the gathering of an assembly, but could only regulate or impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order. Even the State’s power to restrict these rights was limited to the reasons provided in Articles 19(2) and (3) of the Constitution, and not for any other reason. And even then, the restrictions imposed had to follow the principle of least invasiveness171"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,283,". And even then, the restrictions imposed had to follow the principle of least invasiveness171. Whether any restriction imposed by the State was reasonable or not, was a question for the courts to decide through judicial scrutiny. Any action taken by a public authority, such as the police, which restricted fundamental rights must have its basis in law, and must be ‘just, fair, and reasonable’172, a test laid down in Maneka Gandhi v Union of India173. And if any action was found to be restricting fundamental rights, the authority had to show and justify that it was reasonable, or otherwise it would be deemed unconstitutional. Coming to Section 144 of the CrPC, the Court held that it empowered certain Magistrates to direct any person to abstain from doing a certain act or to take action as directed, where sufficient ground for proceeding existed and immediate prevention and/or speedy remedy was desirable. Section 144 was intended to serve the public purpose of protecting public order"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,284,". Section 144 was intended to serve the public purpose of protecting public order. Its powers did restrict fundamental rights, but they were reasonable: It provided a complete procedure to be followed by the Magistrate, specified a time limit for which an order would be valid, and the circumstances that were to be considered by the Magistrate while passing an order under Section 144. Therefore, the power under Section 144 was constitutional and did not violate fundamental rights. Thus, if an authority empowered under Section 144 anticipated imminent threat to public order or tranquility from a meeting or gathering, it could pass temporary orders prohibiting it. This restriction would be reasonable"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,285,". This restriction would be reasonable. However, there were some checks and limits to this power: It could only be used in emergent situations with real threat to public order and tranquility174, the order should be in writing, it should be based on the facts of that particular situation, stating the reasons for imposing the restriction, and the restriction should be minimal and least invasive"

The impact of such an order on persons protesting in exercise of their Article 19(1)(a) and (b) rights 169 Article 19(1) All citizens shall have the right— (a) to freedom of speech and expression; (b) to assemble peacefully and without arms; 170 Article 19(2) - Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence"

(3) - Nothing in sub-clause (b) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause. 171 The restriction should be imposed in a manner and to the extent unavoidable in a given situation. 172 In other words, the restrictive action must not be discriminatory, arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive. 173 AIR 1978 SC 597 174 Section 144 order cannot be passed merely on a ‘likelihood’ or ‘tendency’ to threaten public order. There has to be ‘present danger’ or even an ‘apprehension of danger’. Babulal Parate v State of Maharashtra & Ors., AIR 1961 SC 884. 82 ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLICING IN INDIA would be that the gathering of persons assembled legally, would become an unlawful assembly, if ordered to disperse"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,288,". The empowered authority would also have the necessary power to ensure removal of the assembly, even arresting or detaining them, and if necessary even punishing them under Section 129 of the CrPC175. Such an order could also be passed for a potentially unlawful assembly. Applying this analysis to the facts of the case, the Court held the revocation of Section 144, CrPC to be unjustified. Firstly, the police were well aware of the excess number of people at the site, and the change in purpose of the gathering. Yet they did not take any steps to invoke Section 144 till late into the night. Secondly, no incident or information justified the use of Section 144 as a late night emergency measure, without prior intimation to the organisers and giving them a hearing. At midnight, when the gathered persons were asleep, there was no real threat of communal or social disorder as claimed by the police"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,289,". Nothing was so urgent that it justified waking people up in the middle of the night and forcing their eviction. Importantly, the Court held that although the Section 144 order required the site to be vacated by the gathered public, the police did not make any public announcement of the imposition of Section 144. Thus it did not give the peacefully gathered persons either sufficient time or opportunity to disperse themselves. The Court also held that the right to sleep was a basic human right and a constitutional freedom acknowledged under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, and a sleeping assembly of persons could not be presumed to be illegal to justify an order under Section 144. On a different note, the Court also held that although the right to hold public meetings or protests was a fundamental right, it was the responsibility of the government to maintain public order and tranquility, which it had delegated to the police"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,290,". Thus, the requirement to take permission from the police to hold public meetings or protests was a reasonable restriction of fundamental rights. However, the police had to be objective and could not unduly deny permission requests. Thus, the Court concluded that the restriction of the fundamental right to protest of the gathered protestors in Ramlila Maidan arising from Articles 19(1)(a) and (b) was unreasonable, and therefore unconstitutional. Developments in the Law In Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan v Union of India & Ors.176, the repeated imposition of Section 144 in areas of New Delhi (Parliament House, North and South Block, Central Vista Lawns) by the Delhi Police, prohibiting public meetings, protests, processions, demonstrations, etc. was challenged. The method adopted by the police was that immediately on the expiry of 60 days177 another identical order would be issued, creating a permanent and continuous ban on protests in these areas"

According to the Petitioner, this violated the fundamental right to peaceful assembly. 175 Section 129. Dispersal of assembly by use of civil force. (1) Any executive Magistrate or officer in charge of a police station or, in the absence of such officer in charge, any police officer, not below the rank of a sub- inspector, may command any unlawful assembly, or any assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace, to disperse; and it shall thereupon be the duty of the members of such assembly to disperse accordingly"

(2) If, upon being so commanded, any such assembly does not disperse, or if, without being so commanded, it conducts itself in such a manner as to show a determination not to disperse, any Executive Magistrate or police officer referred to in sub- section (1), may proceed to disperse such assembly by force, and may require the assistance of any male person, not being an officer or member of the armed forces and acting as such, for the purpose of dispersing such assembly, and, if necessary, arresting and confining the persons who form part of it, in order to disperse such assembly or that they may be punished according to law. 176 AIR 2018 SC 3476 177 Under Section 144(4), an order can only be valid for a maximum of two months. 83 HANDBOOK OF LANDMARK JUDGMENTS Thus, the issue before the Court was whether anticipatory action in the form of repeated prohibitory orders under Section 144 could be passed, and whether they were “reasonable restrictions” to fundamental rights"
Landmark Judgments on Human Rights and Policing in India – summaries of 26 Supreme Court judgments.pdf,293,". The Court held that the repeated prohibitory orders created an effective ban on protests. It directed the Commissioner of Police to frame appropriate guidelines to permit and regulate a limited number of demonstrations, instead of banning all of them. However, it also held that the right to protest had to be balanced with the rights of the residents of the area where the protest was being held, and the former could not completely trample upon the latter. This balancing of rights approach was also followed in Amit Sahni v Commissioner of Police & Ors.178 related to the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. The protest site at Shaheen Bagh had been set up on a stretch of a major public access road, causing inconvenience to commuters. The Court held that demonstrations expressing dissent were crucial to the survival of a democracy, but they had to take place in designated areas alone, and not wherever the protestors chose to"

Culpable homicide.--Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. Illustrations (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. (b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,304,". Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide. (c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, 167 although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. Explanation 1.-A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death. Explanation 2.-Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented. Explanation 3.-The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,305,". Explanation 3.-The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. 300. Murder. 300. Murder.--Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or- 2ndly.-If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused. or- 3rdly.-If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or- 4thly"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,306,".-If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. Illustrations (a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. (b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound 168 state of health"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,307,". But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. (d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. Exception 1.-When culpable homicide is not murder"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,308,". Exception 1.-When culpable homicide is not murder.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. The above exception is subject to the following provisos:­ First.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. Secondly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. Thirdly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. Explanation.-Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,309,". Illustrations (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,310,". Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. (e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. Exception 2"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,311,". Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. Exception 2.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence or person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. Illustration Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. Exception 3"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,312,". A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. Exception 3.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. Exception 4.-Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Explanation.-It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault. Exception 5"
THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf,313,". Exception 5.-Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. Illustration 169 A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. 301.
